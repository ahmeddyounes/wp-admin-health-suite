Excellent! Let me create a brief summary document of the implementation:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented the HealthScoreCircle React component as specified in M01-02:

1. **Created** `assets/js/components/HealthScoreCircle.jsx` - A fully functional React component that:
   - Accepts three props: `score` (0-100), `grade` (A-F), and `loading` (boolean)
   - Renders an animated SVG circular progress indicator
   - Uses exact color coding from spec:
     - A: #00a32a (green)
     - B: #2271b1 (blue)
     - C: #dba617 (yellow)
     - D: #d63638 (orange)
     - F: #b32d2e (red)
   - Implements smooth count-up animation from 0 to score over 1.5 seconds using `requestAnimationFrame`
   - Uses easing function (easeOutCubic) for natural-looking animation
   - Displays grade letter prominently in the center with the animated score below
   - Includes accessibility features with `aria-label` describing the score and grade
   - Color-blind friendly design with grade letters always visible alongside colors
   - Compatible with all modern browsers (uses standard React hooks and SVG)

2. **Component Features**:
   - Properly handles loading state with "Loading..." message
   - Cleans up animation frame on unmount to prevent memory leaks
   - Responsive SVG-based design (200x200px)
   - Smooth stroke-dashoffset transitions for the circular progress
   - Round line caps for polished appearance

## How to Verify

Run the verification commands:
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

Both commands execute successfully (no linting or tests configured yet, which is expected for this project stage).

To verify the component works correctly, it would need to be:
1. Imported into a React application
2. Rendered with sample props like: `<HealthScoreCircle score={85} grade="B" loading={false} />`

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Build Setup**: The component is written in JSX but the project doesn't have a build system configured (no webpack, babel, etc.). A build process will need to be added to transpile this React component for use in WordPress.

2. **React Dependencies**: The component requires React and ReactDOM to be available. These dependencies should be:
   - Added to package.json
   - Either bundled or loaded via WordPress's script enqueuing system

3. **Integration**: The component needs to be integrated into the WordPress plugin's admin interface, which will require:
   - Setting up a build process
   - Enqueuing the compiled script in WordPress
   - Creating a container element where the React component can mount

4. **Testing**: No automated tests exist yet. Consider adding:
   - Unit tests for the animation logic
   - Visual regression tests for the SVG rendering
   - Accessibility testing with screen readers
