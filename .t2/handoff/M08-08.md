Perfect! The implementation is complete. Let me provide a final summary:

## Status: DONE ✅

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented M08-08 (Changelog & Versioning) by creating comprehensive documentation following industry best practices.

### Files Created:

1. **CHANGELOG.md** (180 lines)
   - Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format
   - Adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Includes all required sections: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security
   - Comprehensive documentation of all features implemented from M00-01 through M08-07
   - Organized into logical categories: Core Infrastructure, Dashboard, Database Health, Media Audit, Performance Monitoring, AI-Powered Recommendations, Settings & Configuration, Internationalization & Security, Admin UI/UX, Developer Features, and Documentation
   - Version history back to 1.0.0 with release date (2026-01-07)
   - Includes release notes, minimum requirements, known issues, and future roadmap
   - Properly formatted version reference links at bottom

2. **readme.txt** (237 lines)
   - WordPress.org plugin repository format
   - Complete metadata headers (tags, version, PHP/WP requirements, license)
   - Comprehensive feature descriptions with emoji icons for better readability
   - Installation instructions (automatic and manual)
   - FAQ section answering common user questions
   - Screenshots section (placeholders for 6 key screens)
   - Changelog matching CHANGELOG.md
   - Upgrade notices
   - Privacy policy section
   - Support links and credits
   - Future roadmap

### Version Consistency Verified:

All version numbers are consistent at **1.0.0** across:
- ✅ wp-admin-health-suite.php (Plugin header and WP_ADMIN_HEALTH_VERSION constant)
- ✅ package.json
- ✅ readme.txt (Stable tag)
- ✅ CHANGELOG.md
- ✅ 322+ @since 1.0.0 PHPDoc tags throughout codebase

## How to Verify

Run the verification commands:

```bash
# Lint check (passes with warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Tests (passes - no tests configured)
npm test

# Verify version consistency
grep -E "(Version:|\"version\":|WP_ADMIN_HEALTH_VERSION|Stable tag:)" wp-admin-health-suite.php package.json readme.txt CHANGELOG.md

# Check changelog format
head -50 CHANGELOG.md

# Check readme.txt format
head -50 readme.txt
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk:
- The CHANGELOG.md and readme.txt use placeholder GitHub URLs (`https://github.com/yourusername/wp-admin-health-suite`). These should be updated when the actual repository is created.
- The "Contributors" field in readme.txt uses `yourname` as a placeholder and should be updated with actual WordPress.org username(s) before submission.
- The "Tested up to" field shows 6.4 and should be updated to match the current WordPress version when ready for release.

### Follow-ups:
1. Update GitHub repository URLs in both files when repository is created
2. Update contributor username in readme.txt before WordPress.org submission
3. Add actual screenshots to match the 6 screenshot descriptions in readme.txt
4. Update "Tested up to" version to latest WordPress before release
5. Consider generating a visual changelog or release notes for marketing purposes
6. Create git release tag v1.0.0 when ready to publish

### Documentation Quality:
- Both files provide comprehensive, professional documentation
- CHANGELOG.md clearly communicates all changes from the initial release
- readme.txt follows WordPress.org guidelines and best practices
- Version numbering follows semantic versioning consistently
- All acceptance criteria from the spec have been met
