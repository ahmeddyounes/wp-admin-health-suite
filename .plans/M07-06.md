# M07-06 — React Components Build System

Configure webpack/esbuild for React components. Entry points per admin page. Output to /assets/js/dist/. Development: source maps, hot reload proxy. Production: minified, tree-shaken. Dependencies externalized: React, ReactDOM, wp.* packages. CSS modules or styled-components for component styles. Build command in package.json. Acceptance: Build produces optimized bundles, development workflow is fast, dependencies aren't duplicated.
