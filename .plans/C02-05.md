# C02-05 — Stop constructing infrastructure inside integrations

Refactor `includes/Integrations/AbstractIntegration.php` to require injected `ConnectionInterface` and `CacheInterface` (no `new WpdbConnection()` / `CacheFactory::get_instance()` inside); update built-in integrations accordingly; update or add unit tests for integration initialization.
