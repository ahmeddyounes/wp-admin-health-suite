# C02-04 — Make integrations container-resolved

Introduce an integration factory/resolver so `IntegrationManager` does not instantiate integrations via `new`; register built-in integrations (WooCommerce/Elementor/ACF/Multilingual) in the container with injected dependencies; preserve `wpha_register_integrations` hook behavior.
