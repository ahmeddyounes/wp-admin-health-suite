# M10-06 — WPML/Polylang Compatibility

Create /includes/integrations/class-multilingual.php. Detect WPML or Polylang active. Ensure translated media not flagged as unused. Handle duplicate translations in media scanning. Respect language context in admin pages. Acceptance: Translated content media detected correctly, language-specific scans work, no false positives on translated media.
