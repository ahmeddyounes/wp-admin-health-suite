# M04-01 — Plugin Performance Profiler

Create /includes/performance/class-plugin-profiler.php. Methods: measure_plugin_impact(), get_slowest_plugins(limit), get_plugin_memory_usage(), get_plugin_query_counts(), get_asset_counts_by_plugin(). Measurement: temporarily capture query count, memory, time during admin_init with each plugin active. Store results in transient. Calculate: queries added, memory increase, load time impact. Display: ranked list with impact scores. Note: This is approximation, not exact profiling. Acceptance: Provides reasonable estimates of plugin impact, clearly communicates approximate nature, helps identify problem plugins.
