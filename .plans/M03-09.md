# M03-09 — Media Exclusion Manager

Create /includes/media/class-exclusions.php. Methods: add_exclusion(attachment_id, reason), remove_exclusion(attachment_id), get_exclusions(), is_excluded(attachment_id), bulk_add_exclusions(ids), clear_exclusions(). Store in options as serialized array with metadata: {attachment_id, excluded_at, reason, excluded_by}. Integrate with scanner to skip excluded items. UI to manage exclusions: view list, remove individual, clear all. Acceptance: Excluded items never appear in cleanup suggestions, exclusion list persists across scans, manageable through UI.
