# C03-08 — Safe-mode consistency audit + tests

Audit destructive operations (DB cleanup, media deletion) across REST, cron, and admin actions to ensure safe mode is enforced consistently (preview-only where required). Add integration tests toggling safe mode via settings/constants and verifying no destructive writes occur (or that results indicate preview-only).
