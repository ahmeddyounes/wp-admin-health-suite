# C03-07 — Add observability for lock/rate-limit events

Instrument lock contention and rate limit events with safe logging (no sensitive payloads). Use `ActivityLoggerInterface` when available (or a dedicated logger) and ensure logging is gated appropriately (settings/debug). Add doc notes explaining how to diagnose contention/rate limiting.
