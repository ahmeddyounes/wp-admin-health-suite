# C01-10 — Ensure JS bundle dependencies include wp-api-fetch

Verify `assets/js/dist/assets.php` dependencies include `wp-api-fetch` for bundles using `wp.apiFetch`; if not guaranteed, update `includes/Assets.php` to include `wp-api-fetch` as a baseline dependency; confirm no missing-script errors on admin pages.
