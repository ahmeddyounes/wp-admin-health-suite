# M04-04 — Admin Ajax Monitor

Create /includes/performance/class-ajax-monitor.php. Methods: log_ajax_request(), get_ajax_summary(period), get_frequent_ajax_actions(), get_slow_ajax_actions(). Hook into wp_ajax_* and track: action name, execution time, memory used, user role, timestamp. Aggregate: requests per minute, average response time, most frequent actions. Identify: excessive polling, slow endpoints, redundant requests. Store in custom table with daily cleanup. Acceptance: Captures all admin AJAX, aggregates meaningfully, identifies optimization opportunities.
