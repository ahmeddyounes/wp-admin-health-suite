# C03-05 — Migrate AI Recommendations caching to CacheInterface

Refactor `includes/AI/Recommendations.php` to use `CacheInterface` (and/or Options) for cached recommendations and dismissed recommendation state instead of raw transients. Make multisite scope explicit. Add tests for: cache set/get, dismissal filtering, and force refresh behavior.
