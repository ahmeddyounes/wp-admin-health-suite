# C01-05 — Fix Composer autoload casing and redundancy

Update `composer.json` to remove or correct redundant `autoload.classmap` entries that have case-mismatched paths (e.g., `includes/rest` vs `includes/REST`); rely on PSR-4 where possible; run `composer dump-autoload -o` and ensure no class resolution regressions.
