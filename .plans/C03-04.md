# C03-04 — Standardize cache keys and migrate Analyzer caching

Create a central cache key convention (e.g., `includes/Support/CacheKeys.php`) and migrate `includes/Database/Analyzer.php` transient usage to `CacheInterface` (or a dedicated cache adapter) while keeping TTL semantics. Add tests verifying cache hit/miss behavior and key names.
