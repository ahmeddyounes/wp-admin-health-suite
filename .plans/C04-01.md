# C04-01 — Define canonical JS API surface

Choose `assets/js/utils/api.js` as the canonical REST client and standardize on `window.WPAdminHealth.api` as the single supported global client. Update docs (add `docs/developers/js-api.md` or update existing docs) describing the stable JS API surface: `WPAdminHealth.api`, `WPAdminHealth.Events`, `WPAdminHealth.extensions`.
