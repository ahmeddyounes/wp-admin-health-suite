# C01-01 — Decide autoload strategy

Confirm whether production runtime should prefer Composer autoload (`vendor/autoload.php`) with fallback to `includes/autoload.php`, or keep the custom autoloader as primary (prefer only composer autoload); document decision in `docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md` and `README.md`; define acceptance criteria (Linux case-safe, tests/CI consistent).
