# M00-01 — Project Scaffolding & Directory Structure

Create WordPress plugin scaffolding with the following structure: /wp-admin-health-suite/ as root containing: wp-admin-health-suite.php (main plugin file), /includes/ (core classes), /admin/ (admin-specific code), /assets/css/, /assets/js/, /assets/images/, /languages/ (i18n), /templates/ (admin views), /vendor/ (dependencies if any). Main plugin file must include: Plugin Name, Description, Version 1.0.0, Author, License GPL v2+, Text Domain 'wp-admin-health-suite', Domain Path '/languages'. Use namespace WPAdminHealth. Implement PSR-4 autoloading. Add index.php with die() in each directory. Acceptance: Plugin activates without errors on WP 6.0+, PHP 7.4+.
