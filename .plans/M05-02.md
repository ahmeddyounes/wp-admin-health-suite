# M05-02 — One-Click Fix System

Create /includes/ai/class-one-click-fix.php. Methods: get_safe_fixes(), execute_fix(recommendation_id), execute_all_safe(), get_fix_preview(recommendation_id). Safe fixes (auto-executable): clear expired transients, delete spam comments >30 days, clean post revisions keeping 3, optimize tables. Preview shows: what will be affected, estimated impact. Batch execution with progress tracking. All fixes logged to activity. Rollback info stored for 24 hours. Acceptance: Safe fixes never cause data loss, previews are accurate, execution is reliable with progress feedback.
