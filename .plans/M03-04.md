# M03-04 — Large File Identifier

Create /includes/media/class-large-files.php. Methods: find_large_files(threshold_kb), get_optimization_suggestions(), get_size_distribution(). Default threshold: 500KB. For each large file return: ID, filename, current size, suggested max size, potential savings, dimensions. Suggestions based on: images over 2000px on either dimension, unoptimized formats (BMP, TIFF), PNGs that should be JPGs. Size distribution: buckets (<100KB, 100-500KB, 500KB-1MB, 1-5MB, >5MB) with counts. Acceptance: Accurately identifies large files, suggestions are actionable, distribution helps understand library composition.
