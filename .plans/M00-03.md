# M00-03 — Database Schema & Installation

Create /includes/class-installer.php handling plugin installation. Create custom tables on activation: {prefix}wpha_scan_history (id, scan_type, items_found, items_cleaned, bytes_freed, created_at), {prefix}wpha_scheduled_tasks (id, task_type, frequency, last_run, next_run, status, settings JSON). Use dbDelta() for table creation. Store plugin version in options. Add upgrade routine checking version. Create uninstall.php that removes all tables and options when DELETE_PLUGIN_DATA constant is true. Acceptance: Tables created with proper charset/collation, upgrade path works, clean uninstall removes all data.
