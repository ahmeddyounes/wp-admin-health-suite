# M10-02 — Multisite Compatibility

Ensure multisite support. Network activation option. Per-site vs network-wide settings option. Scan options: current site only or network-wide (super admin only). Dashboard widget per site. Shared scan results storage option. Test on subdirectory and subdomain multisite. Acceptance: Plugin works correctly on multisite, network admin has additional options, per-site isolation works.
