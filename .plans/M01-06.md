# M01-06 — Dashboard REST Endpoints

Create /includes/rest/class-dashboard-controller.php. Endpoints: GET /wpha/v1/dashboard/stats (returns all dashboard metrics), GET /wpha/v1/dashboard/health-score (returns score + factors), GET /wpha/v1/dashboard/activity (paginated activity log), POST /wpha/v1/dashboard/quick-action (executes action by ID). Stats endpoint aggregates: total_db_size, total_media_count, cleanable_items, last_cleanup_date. Cache stats in transient for 5 minutes. Acceptance: Endpoints return correct data structure, caching reduces DB load, actions execute and log properly.
