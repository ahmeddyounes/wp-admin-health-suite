# M02-08 — Database Health REST Endpoints

Create /includes/rest/class-database-controller.php. Endpoints: GET /wpha/v1/database/stats (all analyzer stats), GET /wpha/v1/database/revisions (revision details), GET /wpha/v1/database/transients (transient list), GET /wpha/v1/database/orphaned (orphaned data summary), POST /wpha/v1/database/clean (execute cleanup by type), POST /wpha/v1/database/optimize (run optimization). Clean endpoint accepts: {type: 'revisions'|'transients'|'spam'|'trash'|'orphaned', options: {}}. All POST endpoints log to activity. Acceptance: Full CRUD for database operations, proper validation, activity logging works.
