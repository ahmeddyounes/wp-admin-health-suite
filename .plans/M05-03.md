# M05-03 — Recommendations UI Component

Create /assets/js/components/Recommendations.jsx. Display: prioritized list with severity indicators (critical/warning/info), category icons, expandable details, action buttons. Actions: 'Fix Now' (executes immediately), 'Preview' (shows impact), 'Dismiss' (hides recommendation), 'Learn More' (external link). Filter by category. Sort by priority/category. Animate completion of fixes. Empty state when all addressed. Acceptance: List renders correctly, actions work, dismissed items persist in localStorage, animations are smooth.
