# C02-07 — Align scheduled tasks with application layer

Refactor scheduled task implementations (`includes/Database/Tasks/DatabaseCleanupTask.php`, `includes/Media/Tasks/MediaScanTask.php`, `includes/Performance/Tasks/PerformanceCheckTask.php`) to call the same use-cases used by REST (e.g., `RunCleanup`/`RunOptimization`/`RunScan`/`CollectMetrics`). Ensure tasks honor safe mode, progress persistence, and return `TaskResult`-compatible arrays. Add/extend tests to verify task execution paths are unified.
