# M07-01 — Admin Styles - Core

Create /assets/css/admin.css. Design system: use WP admin colors via CSS variables (--wp-admin-theme-color), 8px grid spacing, consistent border-radius (4px), shadow levels (sm, md, lg). Component styles: cards, buttons, form elements, tables, modals, toasts, progress bars. Responsive: stack on <782px. Dark mode support via prefers-color-scheme. Scope all styles to .wpha-wrap to prevent conflicts. Acceptance: Consistent with WP admin aesthetic, responsive, no style conflicts with other plugins.
