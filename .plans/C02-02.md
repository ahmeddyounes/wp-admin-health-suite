# C02-02 — Unify admin bootstrap classes

Replace the two-class pattern (`includes/Admin.php` bootstrapping + `admin/Admin.php` implementation) with a single container-managed admin UI service (or clearly separated `MenuRegistrar`/`PageRenderer` services); update `includes/Providers/BootstrapServiceProvider.php` to bind/boot the new services.
