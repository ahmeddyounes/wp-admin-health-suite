# M10-03 — WooCommerce Integration

Create /includes/integrations/class-woocommerce.php. Detect WooCommerce active. Additional cleanups: expired sessions (woocommerce_sessions table), orphaned variation meta, transients (wc_ prefix with caution). Media scan: include product gallery images. Performance: WooCommerce-specific slow query detection. Conditional loading only when WooCommerce active. Acceptance: WooCommerce cleanups work safely, product images never flagged as unused, performance insights WooCommerce-specific.
