# M03-08 — Media Audit Admin Page

Create /templates/admin/media-audit.php with React app. Sections: Scan status banner (last scan time, 'Rescan' button), Stats overview (total media, unused count, duplicates count, potential savings), Tabbed results view (Unused, Duplicates, Large Files, Missing Alt Text). Each tab: sortable/filterable table, thumbnail preview, checkbox selection, bulk actions. Bulk actions: Delete Selected, Ignore Selected (adds to exclusion list). Duplicate view: grouped display with 'Keep Original' selector. Acceptance: Tables perform well with 1000+ items, bulk selection works, previews load lazily.
