# M06-08 — Settings Admin Page

Create /templates/admin/settings.php. Tabbed interface matching WP settings pages style. Each section as tab. Save button per tab or unified save. Success/error notices on save. Settings export/import in Advanced tab with file upload. Reset section per tab. Preview of scheduled tasks showing next run times. Acceptance: Tabs work correctly, save provides feedback, export creates valid JSON, import validates and applies.
