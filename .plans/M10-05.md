# M10-05 — ACF Integration

Create /includes/integrations/class-acf.php. Scan ACF field types: image, gallery, file. Parse field groups for image fields. Query postmeta for ACF image references. Handle repeater and flexible content fields (nested images). Acceptance: ACF image fields detected, nested field images found, no false positives.
