# C02-06 — Refactor REST controllers to use application layer consistently

Refactor REST controllers that currently orchestrate multiple domain services directly to depend on application-layer use-cases (where it reduces coupling). Target controllers: `includes/REST/Performance/QueryAnalysisController.php`, `includes/REST/Performance/PluginProfilerController.php`, `includes/REST/Performance/AutoloadController.php`, `includes/REST/Performance/CacheController.php`, and any dashboard recommendations path. Acceptance: controllers become thin (validation + call use-case + format_response), and response shapes remain backward compatible for the JS UI.
