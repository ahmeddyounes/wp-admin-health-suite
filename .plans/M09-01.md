# M09-01 — Unit Tests Setup

Configure PHPUnit for WordPress plugin testing. Create /tests/ directory with bootstrap.php loading WP test framework. Test database configuration. Base test class extending WP_UnitTestCase. Factories for creating test posts, attachments, comments. Acceptance: phpunit command runs tests, test database is isolated, factories work correctly.
