# M05-01 — AI Recommendations Engine

Create /includes/ai/class-recommendations.php. Methods: generate_recommendations(), prioritize_issues(), get_actionable_steps(), dismiss_recommendation(id). Analyze all scan results and generate prioritized recommendations. Format: {id, priority (1-10), category, title, description, impact_estimate, action_type, action_params}. Categories: database, media, performance, security. Priority based on: impact (space/speed), ease of fix, risk level. Cache recommendations, regenerate on new scan. Acceptance: Recommendations are genuinely actionable, priorities make sense, dismissed items stay dismissed.
