Perfect! Let me provide a final summary of the implementation.

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented the settings admin page with a tabbed interface matching WordPress settings page style as specified in M06-08.

### Files Modified:

1. **templates/admin/settings.php** (templates/admin/settings.php:1-438)
   - Converted from basic settings form to full tabbed interface
   - Added tab navigation with 6 tabs: General, Database Cleanup, Media Audit, Performance, Scheduling, and Advanced
   - Each tab displays only its relevant settings fields in a clean WordPress-style form table
   - Added "Reset This Section" functionality for each standard tab
   - Advanced tab includes Import/Export/Reset tools in a grid layout with styled cards
   - Scheduling tab includes a preview table showing scheduled tasks with their next run times and status badges

2. **includes/class-settings.php** (includes/class-settings.php:608, 966-1005)
   - Added `reset_section()` method to handle per-section settings reset
   - Registered new admin post action handler for `wpha_reset_section`
   - Method validates section, resets only fields in that section to defaults, and redirects with success message

### Features Implemented:

✅ **Tabbed Interface**: WordPress-style nav-tab-wrapper with 6 tabs
✅ **Save Functionality**: Save button per tab with WordPress settings API integration
✅ **Success/Error Notices**: Settings errors and custom success messages displayed
✅ **Export Settings**: Creates valid JSON file with timestamp and version info
✅ **Import Settings**: File upload with validation and sanitization
✅ **Reset All Settings**: Confirmation dialog before resetting all settings
✅ **Reset Per Section**: Each tab (except Advanced/Scheduling) has section-specific reset
✅ **Scheduled Tasks Preview**: Table showing task name, frequency, next run time, and status
✅ **Status Badges**: Color-coded badges (Scheduled/Disabled/Not Scheduled)
✅ **Proper Styling**: Matches WordPress admin design patterns

## How to Verify

### Manual Testing:
1. Access the settings page: `wp-admin > Admin Health > Settings`
2. Test tab navigation between all 6 sections
3. Modify settings in each tab and save - verify success notice appears
4. Test export: Export settings and verify JSON file downloads
5. Test import: Import previously exported JSON file and verify settings apply
6. Test section reset: Reset a specific section and verify only those settings reset
7. Test full reset: Reset all settings from Advanced tab
8. View Scheduling tab: Check scheduled tasks preview table shows correct information

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check PHP syntax
php -l templates/admin/settings.php
php -l includes/class-settings.php

# Run lint (when configured)
npm run lint

# Run tests (when configured)
npm test
```

All syntax checks passed successfully.

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk:
- **Import validation**: Currently validates JSON structure but could be enhanced with schema validation
- **Success messages**: Section reset uses same 'reset' message as full reset - could differentiate

### Potential Enhancements:
- Move inline CSS to separate stylesheet for better maintainability
- Add AJAX save functionality for better UX
- Add "dirty form" detection to warn users of unsaved changes
- Enhanced import validation with version compatibility checks

### Notes:
- Settings export includes plugin version and timestamp for tracking
- Scheduled tasks preview works with both Action Scheduler and WP-Cron
- All user inputs are properly sanitized and validated
- Nonce checks protect all form submissions
