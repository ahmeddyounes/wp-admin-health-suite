**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive testing documentation review at `docs/testing-documentation-review.md` that analyzes:

1. **Test Setup Instructions** - Reviewed TESTING.md and tests/README.md for accuracy of prerequisites and setup steps

2. **Running Tests Guide** - Identified documentation gaps including:
   - Missing documentation for `composer test:standalone` (standalone tests without WordPress)
   - Missing documentation for `composer test:all` 
   - Undocumented `phpunit-standalone.xml` configuration
   - Directory structure documentation is outdated (uses old file naming conventions)

3. **Contributing Test Guidelines** - Evaluated:
   - Best practices coverage (good)
   - Missing namespace conventions documentation
   - Missing guidance on when to use standalone vs WordPress-integrated tests
   - Example code uses outdated class naming (`Test_Case` vs `TestCase`)

4. **Key Findings**:
   - File naming references are outdated (e.g., `test-case.php` should be `TestCase.php`, `class-post-factory.php` should be `PostFactory.php`)
   - Standalone testing infrastructure is undocumented (unit-standalone directory, StandaloneTestCase class, bootstrap-standalone.php)
   - Mocks directory is not documented
   - Factory methods are only partially documented

## How to Verify

```bash
# View the review document
cat docs/testing-documentation-review.md

# Run linter (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Medium Priority**: The documentation issues identified should be fixed in TESTING.md and tests/README.md to reflect the actual project structure

2. **Low Priority**: Consider consolidating TESTING.md and tests/README.md into a single source of truth to avoid maintenance overhead

3. **No Breaking Changes**: This task only created a review document - no code or configuration was modified
