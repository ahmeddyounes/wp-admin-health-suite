Now let me create one final comprehensive summary of the implementation:\n\n---\n\n## Status: DONE ✅\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI have successfully implemented the M10-03 WooCommerce Integration as specified. The implementation includes:\n\n### 1. **Created Integration Infrastructure** (includes/integrations/)\n   - Created new `includes/integrations/` directory\n   - Added `class-woocommerce.php` with comprehensive WooCommerce integration\n   - Added security index.php file\n\n### 2. **WooCommerce Detection**\n   - Static `is_active()` method that checks for WooCommerce class existence\n   - Conditional loading only when WooCommerce is active\n\n### 3. **Database Cleanup Features**\n   - **Expired Sessions**: Detects and cleans expired sessions from `woocommerce_sessions` table\n   - **Orphaned Variation Meta**: Identifies and removes orphaned product variation metadata\n   - **WooCommerce Transients**: Counts and manages WC-prefixed transients with caution\n   - All cleanups include size estimation and logging to scan history\n\n### 4. **Media Scanner Integration**\n   - Added filter hook `wpha_media_is_attachment_used` to protect product images\n   - Checks for:\n     - Product featured images (thumbnail)\n     - Product gallery images (`_product_image_gallery` meta)\n     - Product variation images\n   - Ensures WooCommerce product images are NEVER flagged as unused\n\n### 5. **Performance Monitoring**\n   - Adjusted slow query threshold specifically for WooCommerce queries (100ms)\n   - WooCommerce-specific query detection based on table names and post types\n   - `get_slow_wc_queries()` method for retrieving WooCommerce-specific slow queries\n   - Performance insights that warn about:\n     - Large numbers of expired sessions\n     - Orphaned variation metadata\n     - Excessive WooCommerce transients\n\n### 6. **Plugin Integration**\n   - Modified `includes/Plugin.php` to:\n     - Add WooCommerce integration property\n     - Initialize WooCommerce integration when active\n     - Add getter method `get_woocommerce()`\n   - Uses PSR-4 autoloading (no manual require needed)\n\n### 7. **Additional Features**\n   - `get_wc_version()`: Returns WooCommerce version\n   - `get_wc_tables()`: Lists all existing WooCommerce database tables\n   - `get_cleanup_data()`: Provides overview of cleanup opportunities\n   - `get_performance_insights()`: Returns actionable performance recommendations\n\n## How to Verify\n\n### Exact Commands:\n```bash\n# 1. Lint check (should pass with only warnings)\nnpm run lint\n\n# 2. Run tests (should pass all 101 tests)\nnpm test\n\n# 3. PHP syntax check\nphp -l includes/integrations/class-woocommerce.php\nphp -l includes/Plugin.php\n\n# 4. Verify file structure\nls -la includes/integrations/\n\n# 5. Manual testing (if WooCommerce is installed):\n# - The integration will automatically load when WooCommerce is active\n# - Product images will be protected from being flagged as unused\n# - WooCommerce-specific cleanup options will be available\n# - Performance monitoring will include WooCommerce-specific insights\n```\n\n### Expected Results:\n- ✅ Linting passes (101 warnings are pre-existing)\n- ✅ All 101 tests pass\n- ✅ No PHP syntax errors\n- ✅ Integration loads conditionally when WooCommerce is active\n- ✅ Product gallery images are never flagged as unused\n- ✅ WooCommerce-specific cleanups are available\n- ✅ Performance insights include WooCommerce-specific queries\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n### Low Risk Items:\n1. **Testing with WooCommerce**: This implementation has been written defensively with proper table existence checks, but should be tested with an actual WooCommerce installation to ensure all edge cases are covered.\n\n2. **Transient Cleanup Safety**: WooCommerce transients are handled with caution (as specified). Users should be warned that clearing all WC transients may temporarily impact performance as caches rebuild.\n\n3. **Orphaned Meta Detection**: The query for orphaned variation meta uses a subquery which could be slow on very large databases. Consider adding batching if performance issues arise.\n\n### Follow-up Recommendations:\n1. Add REST API endpoints for WooCommerce-specific cleanup operations\n2. Add UI elements in the admin dashboard to display WooCommerce health metrics\n3. Consider adding support for other popular WooCommerce extensions (subscriptions, bookings, etc.)\n4. Add automated tests that mock WooCommerce being active\n5. Add PHPUnit tests for the WooCommerce integration class\n\n### Notes:\n- The integration uses WordPress hooks and filters (`wpha_media_is_attachment_used`, `wpha_slow_query_threshold`) to extend functionality\n- All database queries use prepared statements for security\n- Batch processing (BATCH_SIZE = 100) prevents timeouts on large operations\n- Integration follows the same coding standards and patterns as existing codebase classes","session_id":"c5c69d5f-3d53-4cea-a3a4-6314727bb442","total_cost_usd":1.1756390999999997,"usage":{"input_tokens":72,"cache_creation_input_tokens":79764,"cache_read_input_tokens":1787897,"output_tokens":11100,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":79764}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":18814,"outputTokens":445,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":15558,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.04048650000000001,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":72,"outputTokens":11100,"cacheReadInputTokens":1787897,"cacheCreationInputTokens":79764,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.0022001,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":3,"outputTokens":1396,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":15686,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.13295249999999997,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"c7dee094-49ce-4666-94cb-3d85f5f5a1c1"}
