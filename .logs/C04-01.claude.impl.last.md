All 10 tests for the SchedulingService pass. Now let me provide the final summary.

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created a new `SchedulingService` as the single authority for managing task schedules across WP-Cron and Action Scheduler. The implementation includes:

### New Files Created

1. **`includes/Scheduler/Contracts/SchedulingServiceInterface.php`**
   - Defines the contract for the centralized scheduling service
   - Methods: `schedule()`, `reschedule()`, `unschedule()`, `unschedule_all()`, `get_next_run()`, `is_scheduled()`, `get_frequency()`, `reconcile()`, `get_status()`, `calculate_next_run_time()`, `is_action_scheduler_available()`

2. **`includes/Scheduler/SchedulingService.php`**
   - Implements `SchedulingServiceInterface`
   - Supports both WP-Cron and Action Scheduler (with preference for Action Scheduler)
   - Contains task configuration for `database_cleanup`, `media_scan`, and `performance_check`
   - `reconcile()` method compares current schedules against `wpha_settings` and adjusts accordingly
   - `get_status()` returns comprehensive status for all tasks

3. **`tests/unit-standalone/Scheduler/SchedulingServiceTest.php`**
   - Unit tests for the SchedulingService (10 tests, 34 assertions)
   - Tests task configuration, next run time calculation, interface contract

### Modified Files

1. **`includes/Providers/SchedulerServiceProvider.php`**
   - Added `SchedulingService` and `SchedulingServiceInterface` imports
   - Registered `SchedulingServiceInterface` as a singleton in the container
   - Added `'scheduler.service'` alias
   - Service is injected with `SettingsInterface` and `SchedulerRegistryInterface`

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run ESLint (JavaScript)
npm run lint

# Run Jest tests (JavaScript)
npm test

# Run PHP syntax check on new files
php -l includes/Scheduler/SchedulingService.php
php -l includes/Scheduler/Contracts/SchedulingServiceInterface.php
php -l includes/Providers/SchedulerServiceProvider.php

# Run PHPCS on new files
./vendor/bin/phpcs includes/Scheduler/SchedulingService.php includes/Scheduler/Contracts/SchedulingServiceInterface.php includes/Providers/SchedulerServiceProvider.php

# Run SchedulingService unit tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml --filter SchedulingServiceTest
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Integration with existing code**: The `SettingsServiceProvider` still has its own `handle_scheduling_update()` method that duplicates scheduling logic. Consider migrating it to use the new `SchedulingService::reconcile()` method in a future task.

2. **WordPress-dependent tests**: Some methods (`get_status()`, `reconcile()`, `schedule()`, `unschedule()`) require WordPress functions and should have additional integration tests with WordPress loaded.

3. **Action Scheduler detection**: The service checks for Action Scheduler availability at runtime via `function_exists()`. This is the standard pattern but could be improved with a dedicated abstraction layer.

4. **Backward compatibility**: The existing `SchedulerRegistry` still has its own `schedule_task()` and `unschedule_task()` methods. Consider deprecating those in favor of using `SchedulingService` as the single authority.
