**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created `docs/main-plugin-file-review.md` - a comprehensive review document covering:

1. **Plugin Headers** - Complete analysis of all required and optional headers, verification of consistency across files
2. **License Compliance** - Verified GPL v2 or later licensing across plugin header, readme.txt, and composer.json
3. **Minimum Requirements Checks** - Documented multi-layer PHP 7.4 and WP 6.0 verification system
4. **Bootstrap Logic** - Detailed initialization flow from direct access guard through plugin activation
5. **Activation/Deactivation Hooks** - Proper multisite support with custom action hooks
6. **Security Best Practices** - Direct access prevention, output escaping, namespace isolation
7. **Autoloader Integration** - PSR-4 compliant autoloading
8. **Dependency Injection** - Service provider architecture
9. **Code Quality Analysis** - Documentation, organization, WordPress coding standards compliance
10. **Comparison with readme.txt** - Version and header consistency verification

**Overall Rating: Excellent** - The implementation is production-ready with only minor recommendations (updating placeholder author values, adding a LICENSE file).

## How to Verify

```bash
# View the review document
cat docs/main-plugin-file-review.md

# Run lint (warnings are pre-existing, not from this task)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

**Low Risk:**
- Placeholder values (Author, Author URI) should be updated before publishing to WordPress.org
- Consider adding a LICENSE file containing the full GPL-2.0 text to the root directory
- Optional: Add `Tested up to` header to match readme.txt
