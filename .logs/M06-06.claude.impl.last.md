Perfect! The implementation is complete. Let me create a final summary:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented the Scheduling Settings Section (M06-06) with all required fields and functionality.

### Modified Files:
- `includes/class-settings.php` (325+ lines added/modified)

### Changes Made:

1. **Updated Scheduling Fields** (lines 451-540):
   - Replaced `enable_scheduling` with `scheduler_enabled` (bool) - enables/disables all automated scheduling
   - Replaced `cleanup_frequency` with `database_cleanup_frequency` (daily/weekly/monthly/disabled)
   - Replaced `scan_frequency` with `media_scan_frequency` (weekly/monthly/disabled)
   - Added `performance_check_frequency` (daily/weekly)
   - Added `preferred_time` (hour selector 0-23 with AM/PM labels)
   - Added `notification_on_completion` (bool) - sends email notifications when tasks complete

2. **Action Scheduler Integration** (lines 569-1011):
   - Added `handle_scheduling_update()` method - automatically called when settings are saved
   - Added `schedule_task()` method - schedules tasks using Action Scheduler with WP-Cron fallback
   - Added `unschedule_task()` and `unschedule_all_tasks()` methods
   - Added `calculate_next_run_time()` method - respects the preferred_time setting
   - Added helper methods `get_interval_seconds()` and `get_cron_schedule_name()`
   - Hooks: `wpha_database_cleanup`, `wpha_media_scan`, `wpha_performance_check`
   - Group: `wpha_scheduling` (for Action Scheduler)

3. **Notification System** (lines 1100-1155):
   - Added `send_completion_notification()` public method
   - Sends email to notification_email (or admin_email as fallback)
   - Includes task name, results, and link to dashboard
   - Only sends if notification_on_completion is enabled

### Key Features:
- Full Action Scheduler support with automatic WP-Cron fallback
- Schedules create/update automatically when settings are saved
- Time preference is respected (calculates next run time based on preferred hour)
- Individual tasks can be disabled by setting frequency to "disabled"
- When scheduler is disabled, all tasks are automatically unscheduled
- Notifications include task results and dashboard link

## How to Verify

### Verification Commands:
```bash
# Check PHP syntax
php -l includes/class-settings.php

# Run lint (not configured yet)
npm run lint

# Run tests (not configured yet)
npm test
```

### Manual Testing:
1. Navigate to WordPress Admin → Admin Health → Settings → Scheduling tab
2. Verify all 6 fields are present:
   - Enable Scheduler (checkbox)
   - Database Cleanup Frequency (select with disabled option)
   - Media Scan Frequency (select with disabled option)
   - Performance Check Frequency (select)
   - Preferred Time (hour selector with AM/PM times)
   - Notification on Completion (checkbox)
3. Save settings and verify:
   - If Action Scheduler is installed, check that tasks are scheduled in Action Scheduler interface
   - If not, tasks should fall back to WP-Cron (check with `wp cron event list`)
   - Time should match the preferred_time setting
4. Test notifications by calling `Settings::send_completion_notification()` with a task name

### Expected Behavior:
- Settings save successfully without errors
- Action Scheduler tasks are created with correct frequency and timing
- Preferred time is respected in next run calculation
- Disabling individual frequencies removes those specific tasks
- Disabling scheduler removes all scheduled tasks
- Notifications send when enabled and tasks complete

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Risks:
1. **Migration**: Existing installations have `enable_scheduling`, `cleanup_frequency`, and `scan_frequency` fields that are now replaced. The old settings will be ignored but won't cause errors.
2. **Action Scheduler Dependency**: Plugin gracefully degrades to WP-Cron if Action Scheduler is not available.
3. **Task Hooks**: The scheduled hooks (`wpha_database_cleanup`, `wpha_media_scan`, `wpha_performance_check`) need corresponding action handlers to actually execute tasks.

### Follow-ups:
1. **Hook Handlers**: Need to implement actual task execution handlers for:
   - `add_action('wpha_database_cleanup', callback)` in includes/class-settings.php:930
   - `add_action('wpha_media_scan', callback)` in includes/class-settings.php:930
   - `add_action('wpha_performance_check', callback)` in includes/class-settings.php:930
   
2. **Settings Migration**: Consider adding a one-time migration to copy old field values to new field names for existing users.

3. **Testing**: Add unit tests for scheduling logic, time calculations, and notification sending.

4. **Documentation**: Update user documentation to explain the new scheduling options.

5. **Action Scheduler UI**: Consider adding a link to Action Scheduler's admin interface for users to monitor scheduled tasks.
