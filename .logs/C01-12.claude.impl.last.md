The documentation updates look complete and well-structured. Both files now clearly describe:

1. The two supported bootstrap paths (development with vendor/ vs production without)
2. How autoloading works (automatic detection)
3. How to run tests and lint commands

---

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Updated two documentation files to clearly describe supported bootstrap paths:

1. **README.md** (lines 113-160, 188-250):
   - Added new "Bootstrap and Autoloading" section with:
     - Table showing dev vs prod runtime environments
     - Code snippet showing the autoloader detection logic
     - Case sensitivity explanation with namespace-to-path examples
     - Building for distribution instructions
   - Enhanced "Development" section with:
     - Setup for Development subsection
     - Note about `vendor/` being required for tests

2. **docs/getting-started.md** (lines 59-123):
   - Expanded "Developer Installation" method to include `npm install`
   - Added new "Bootstrap and Autoloading" subsection with:
     - Table showing dev vs prod setups
     - Code snippet showing autoloader detection
     - Explanation of both modes
   - Added new "Running Tests and Linting" subsection with all commands

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run JavaScript linting (should show 0 errors, warnings are pre-existing)
npm run lint

# Run JavaScript tests (all 417 tests should pass)
npm test

# Review the documentation changes
cat README.md | head -270 | tail -170
cat docs/getting-started.md | head -140 | tail -90
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: Documentation-only changes; no code modifications
- **Follow-up**: The existing lint warnings (161 warnings) in JavaScript files are pre-existing and unrelated to this task. They could be addressed in a future cleanup task if desired.
