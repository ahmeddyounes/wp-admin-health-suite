## Summary of Changes

Reviewed and improved `includes/media/DuplicateDetector.php` for accurate duplicate detection, proper image size handling, and performance with large media libraries. Key improvements:

### 1. Performance Optimizations
- **Two-pass hash detection** (`find_duplicates_by_hash`): First groups files by size (fast stat calls), then only hashes files with matching sizes. This dramatically reduces I/O for large libraries where most files have unique sizes.
- **Generator-based iteration** (`get_attachment_ids_generator`): Uses PHP generators with database-level pagination to avoid loading all attachment IDs into memory.
- **Memory monitoring**: Added `is_memory_low()` and `clear_caches()` to detect when memory usage approaches 80% and automatically clean up WordPress object caches.
- **O(1) overlap detection** in `merge_duplicate_groups`: Changed from `in_array()` to array key lookup for faster processing.

### 2. Duplicate Detection Accuracy
- **Pattern detection improvements** (`extract_base_filename`): 
  - Added explicit exclusion of dimension patterns (e.g., `image-150x150.jpg`) to prevent false positives with thumbnails
  - Added support for `-rotated` pattern (WordPress image rotation)
- **Thumbnail exclusion optimization** (`exclude_thumbnails`): Pre-caches all filenames and metadata in a single pass instead of nested loops, improving efficiency from O(n²) to O(n).
- **Type safety**: Added proper type hints (`array`, `int`, `string`, `?string`) throughout for PHP 7.4+ compatibility.

### 3. Image Size Handling
- **MIME type filtering**: `find_duplicates_by_dimensions` now properly filters for images only using the generator's MIME type parameter.
- **Edge case handling**: Added validation for zero-size files and false returns from `filesize()`.

### 4. Code Quality
- **Better documentation**: Added detailed PHPDoc blocks explaining the algorithms, why certain approaches are used, and version history.
- **WordPress coding standards**: Applied PHPCBF auto-fixes for array alignment and equals sign spacing.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (should pass with only pre-existing JS warnings)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 101 tests should pass)
npm test

# Check PHP syntax
php -l includes/media/DuplicateDetector.php

# Optional: Run PHPCS (only filename convention errors remain, which is project-wide)
./vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=WordPress includes/media/DuplicateDetector.php
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **WordPress Integration Tests**: The existing `MediaScannerTest.php` covers duplicate detection via the Scanner class, but dedicated unit tests for `DuplicateDetector` would provide more targeted coverage.

2. **Memory threshold tuning**: The 80% memory threshold is a sensible default, but sites with unusual memory configurations might need adjustment. Consider making this configurable via a filter hook.

3. **Dimension-based detection false positives**: The ~5% size tolerance bucket approach catches re-compressed images but could occasionally flag visually different images with identical dimensions as duplicates. Users should always preview before bulk actions.
