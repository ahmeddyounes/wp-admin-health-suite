Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Hardened attachment file operations: only read `filesize()` for paths validated inside uploads, with URL-based filename fallback (`includes/REST/Media/MediaHelper.php:22`).
- Made destructive media endpoints respect Safe Mode (preview-only; no move/restore), and removed absolute `file_path` from delete responses (`includes/REST/MediaController.php:687`, `includes/REST/Media/MediaCleanupController.php:218`).
- Added `/wpha/v1/media/missing-alt` alias route and de-duped/filtered ID sanitization (`includes/REST/MediaController.php:248`, `includes/REST/Media/MediaAltTextController.php:95`).

How to verify
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups
- If any client relied on `prepared_items[].file_path`, it must be updated (field no longer returned).
- Safe Mode now blocks delete/restore (must disable Safe Mode to execute).
- JS bundles use REST namespace `wp-admin-health/v1` while PHP controllers are on `wpha/v1` (e.g. `assets/js/admin.js:42`); consider aligning/aliasing namespaces if the UI isn’t reaching the endpoints.
