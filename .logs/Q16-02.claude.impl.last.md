## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created `docs/security-documentation-review.md` - a comprehensive review document that evaluates SECURITY.md across three key areas:

1. **Security Measures Documentation** - Assessed as "Excellent" with thorough coverage of:
   - SQL Injection Prevention
   - XSS Prevention  
   - Input Sanitization
   - Nonce Verification
   - Capability Checks
   - Direct File Access Protection
   - File Operations Security
   - Rate Limiting

2. **Vulnerability Reporting Process** - Assessed as "Good" with recommendations to add:
   - Response timeline expectations
   - Severity classification guidance
   - Safe harbor statement for researchers
   - Scope definition

3. **User Security Guidance** - Assessed as "Excellent" with practical configuration examples, production settings guide, and actionable security checklist

The review also evaluates documentation quality, technical accuracy, WordPress compliance, and provides prioritized recommendations for enhancement.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Verify the review document was created
cat docs/security-documentation-review.md

# Run lint (should pass with 0 errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (should pass all 417 tests)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Low Risk** - This is a documentation review task with no code changes, so no functional risk
2. **Follow-up** - Consider implementing the high-priority recommendations:
   - Add response timeline to vulnerability reporting section in SECURITY.md
   - Replace placeholder email (security@example.com) with actual contact
3. **Follow-up** - Consider adding a safe harbor statement for security researchers
