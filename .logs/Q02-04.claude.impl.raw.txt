Scheduled posts (`post_status = 'future'`) are NOT at risk of accidental deletion.\n\n2. **Attachment Cleanup** ✅ - The code uses `wp_delete_post($post_id, true)` which is the correct WordPress function. When deleting attachment posts with `force_delete = true`, WordPress automatically handles underlying file cleanup through its internal hooks.\n\n3. **Comment Spam Removal** ✅ - The code correctly queries `comment_approved = 'spam'` and uses `wp_delete_comment()` with `force_delete = true`. This is safe as it only targets comments explicitly marked as spam.\n\n4. **No Accidental Deletion of Valid Content** ✅ - All queries explicitly filter by:\n   - `post_status = 'trash'` for posts\n   - `comment_approved = 'spam'` or `comment_approved = 'trash'` for comments\n   - Valid content (published, draft, pending, future) is not at risk.\n\n**Bug Fix Made:**\n\nFixed interface mismatch in `includes/Contracts/TrashCleanerInterface.php`:\n- The `empty_all_trash()` method's PHPDoc return type was `array{posts_deleted: int, comments_deleted: int, spam_deleted: int}` \n- Changed to `array{posts_deleted: int, posts_errors: int, comments_deleted: int, comments_errors: int}` to match the actual implementation\n\n## How to Verify\n\n```bash\nnpm run lint    # 0 errors, only pre-existing warnings\nnpm test        # All 101 tests pass\n```\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n1. **Low Risk**: The `empty_all_trash()` method does not delete spam comments, only trashed posts and trashed comments. If spam cleanup is desired in this method, it would need to be added (but this is consistent with the method name \"trash\" not \"spam\").\n\n2. **Consideration**: The `older_than_days` parameter uses `post_modified` for posts (line 173-174 in TrashCleaner.php), not a dedicated \"trashed_at\" timestamp. This is a reasonable approach since WordPress doesn't store a separate trash timestamp, but it means the age filter reflects when the post was last modified, not when it was trashed.","session_id":"8a2174c8-2be1-42fe-b16b-ee8fb44e256a","total_cost_usd":0.991138,"usage":{"input_tokens":1203,"cache_creation_input_tokens":60106,"cache_read_input_tokens":973639,"output_tokens":4432,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":60106}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":1203,"outputTokens":4432,"cacheReadInputTokens":973639,"cacheCreationInputTokens":60106,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.979297,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":11046,"outputTokens":159,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.011841,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"130390c8-e315-44eb-9b29-38dcb221cdaa"}
