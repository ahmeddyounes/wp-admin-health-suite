**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive performance documentation review file (`docs/performance-documentation-review.md`) that evaluates PERFORMANCE.md across three key areas:

1. **Caching Documentation** - Reviewed transient caching, in-memory caching, media scan results caching, and WordPress object cache integration. Verified implementation in Database/Analyzer.php and Media/Scanner.php.

2. **Optimization Strategies** - Analyzed lazy loading CSS, async/defer JavaScript, N+1 query prevention, batch processing, generator usage, memory monitoring, and progress tracking. All documented strategies verified in actual code.

3. **Large Site Handling Guidance** - Evaluated batch processor documentation, generator-based iteration, configurable batch sizes, memory awareness (80% threshold), and timeout prevention. Confirmed support for 100k+ posts.

The review found the PERFORMANCE.md documentation to be **Excellent** overall, with accurate implementation matching documentation claims. Minor recommendations for enhancement were provided (documenting memory threshold configuration, server requirements, and progress update intervals).

## How to Verify

```bash
# Check the review file was created
cat docs/performance-documentation-review.md

# Run linting (pre-existing warnings only)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **None identified** - This is a documentation review task that created a new markdown file. No code changes were made.
- **Low Priority Enhancement** - The review identifies several minor documentation improvements that could be made to PERFORMANCE.md in a future task (documenting 80% memory threshold, progress update intervals, server configuration guidance).
