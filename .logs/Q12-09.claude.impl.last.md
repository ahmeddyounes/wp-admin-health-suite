## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created `assets/js/entries/performance.test.js` with comprehensive tests for the performance entry point. The test file follows the established patterns from other entry point tests (`dashboard.test.js`, `database-health.test.js`, `media-audit.test.js`) and covers:

1. **WPAdminHealthComponents global** - Tests that the global namespace is properly initialized and exposes:
   - `MetricCard` component
   - `Recommendations` component
   - `React` library
   - `createRoot` function

2. **Component exports validation** - Verifies that exported components are valid React components (functions)

3. **Global namespace preservation** - Tests that:
   - The entry point uses `Object.assign` correctly
   - Previously set components are not removed
   - `WPAdminHealthComponents` is properly initialized if not present

4. **Performance-specific component availability** - Tests the availability of components used for performance metrics display and recommendations

5. **React and createRoot availability for chart rendering** - Tests that React utilities are available for mounting performance visualizations

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run only performance entry point tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="assets/js/entries/performance.test.js"

# Run full test suite
npm test

# Run lint check
npm run lint
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **None identified** - The test file follows established patterns and all 244 tests (including the 14 new tests) pass
- Pre-existing lint warnings in other files are unrelated to this change
- The test file properly mocks `admin.js`, `charts.js`, and `performance.js` to isolate the entry point behavior
