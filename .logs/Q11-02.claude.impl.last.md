**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### `includes/Cache/MemoryCache.php`
Enhanced the in-memory cache implementation with:

1. **Configurable memory limits** (lines 41-55, 77-86):
   - Added `DEFAULT_MAX_ITEMS` constant (1000 items)
   - Constructor now accepts `$max_items` parameter to limit cache size
   - Setting `max_items` to 0 allows unlimited caching

2. **LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction** (lines 201-257):
   - Added `evict_if_needed()` method that runs before adding new items
   - Added `evict_lru()` method to remove least recently accessed items
   - Storage now tracks `accessed` timestamp alongside `value` and `expires`

3. **Improved cleanup mechanisms**:
   - Refactored `is_expired()` to be side-effect free (lines 114-135)
   - Added `remove_if_expired()` helper method (lines 137-149)
   - Added `gc()` method for explicit garbage collection of expired items (lines 446-474)
   - Added `flush()` method that clears both storage and statistics (lines 476-489)

4. **Enhanced statistics tracking**:
   - Added `evictions` stat to track LRU evictions (lines 57-68)
   - All cache operations properly update access times for LRU tracking

5. **Additional management methods**:
   - `get_max_items()` to retrieve current limit (lines 491-500)
   - `set_max_items()` to dynamically adjust limit with automatic eviction (lines 502-522)

### `tests/unit-standalone/Cache/MemoryCacheTest.php` (new file)
Created comprehensive test suite (118 test methods) covering:
- Interface implementation verification
- Basic CRUD operations
- TTL/expiration handling
- Memory limits enforcement
- LRU eviction behavior
- Garbage collection
- Clear/flush operations
- Remember pattern
- Increment/decrement operations
- Multiple operations
- Statistics tracking
- Access time tracking
- Edge cases (false, null, empty values, special characters)
- Time provider testing

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (passes with 0 errors, only warnings)
npm run lint

# Run JavaScript tests
npm test

# Run PHP standalone tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml --testdox
```

All tests pass: 466 PHP tests, 1012 assertions; 101 JavaScript tests.

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Breaking change awareness**: The constructor now accepts an optional `$max_items` parameter. Existing code will use the default (1000 items), which may cause unexpected evictions in edge cases. Review any code that creates MemoryCache instances without limits.

2. **LRU overhead**: The LRU eviction scans all items to find the oldest. For large caches near capacity, this could have O(n) performance. For most use cases (in-memory during single request), this is acceptable. If performance becomes an issue, consider using a more sophisticated data structure (e.g., doubly-linked list).

3. **Stats tracking includes evictions**: Code that relies on stats structure should be updated to handle the new `evictions` key.
