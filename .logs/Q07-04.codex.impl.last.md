Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Added Media Audit settings for exclusion patterns and safer deletes (`includes/Settings/Domain/MediaSettings.php:45`), including:
  - Excluded MIME patterns (`exclude_media_types`)
  - Excluded file/path patterns (`exclude_media_file_patterns`)
  - Excluded attachment IDs (`excluded_media_ids`)
  - Require delete confirmation (`require_media_delete_confirmation`)
  - Deduped legacy `media_retention_days` into `media_trash_retention_days`
- Implemented new settings sanitizers and legacy migration (`includes/Settings/SettingsRegistry.php:238`).
- Made media exclusions honor settings-based patterns/IDs across scans + deletes (`includes/Media/Exclusions.php:26`), and wired settings into Media services (`includes/Providers/MediaServiceProvider.php:1`).
- Made Safe Delete retention respect `media_trash_retention_days` (`includes/Media/SafeDelete.php:47`).
- Enforced REST delete confirmation (unless Safe Mode) and updated Media Audit JS to send it + use the exclusions endpoint (`includes/REST/MediaController.php:166`, `includes/REST/Media/MediaCleanupController.php:78`, `assets/js/media-audit.js:1`).

How to verify
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups
- Any external client calling `POST /wpha/v1/media/delete` must now send `confirm=true` (or disable the requirement via settings); otherwise it will receive HTTP 428.
- Enabling MIME/file exclusion patterns adds extra checks during scans (mime/file lookups) and may impact scan time on very large libraries.
