### Features Implemented:

✅ **Overview Cards**
- Total Database Size (calculated from stats API)
- Tables Count (from table_sizes array)
- Potential Savings (estimated from cleanup candidates)

✅ **Cleanup Modules Accordion**
- 5 modules: Revisions, Transients, Spam, Trash, Orphaned Data
- Each shows item count and estimated size
- Collapsible accordion interface
- Module descriptions

✅ **Action Buttons**
- Analyze button: Fetches detailed analysis for each module
- Clean button: Executes cleanup with confirmation
- Disabled state when no items to clean
- Loading states during operations

✅ **Progress Feedback**
- Animated progress bar during cleanup
- Progress text updates
- Smooth transitions

✅ **Results Summary**
- Shows items deleted by category
- Shows space freed (when available)
- Success indicators with icons
- Detailed breakdown for complex operations

✅ **Table Browser**
- Lists all database tables
- Shows: Table Name, Row Count, Data Size, Index Size, Total Size
- Formatted sizes (Bytes, KB, MB, GB)
- WordPress standard table styling

✅ **Confirmations**
- Modal confirmation before cleanup operations
- Prevents accidental data deletion

## How to Verify

Since this is a WordPress plugin, verification requires a WordPress environment:

1. **Install in WordPress:**
   ```bash
   # Copy plugin to WordPress plugins directory
   # Activate plugin in WordPress admin
   ```

2. **Access Database Health Page:**
   - Navigate to WordPress Admin → Admin Health → Database Health
   - Verify overview cards load with data
   - Verify cleanup modules display correctly

3. **Test Functionality:**
   - Click accordion headers to expand/collapse modules
   - Click "Analyze" buttons to see detailed analysis
   - Click "Clean" buttons (in test environment) to test cleanup
   - Verify confirmation dialogs appear
   - Verify progress bars animate
   - Verify results display correctly
   - Check table browser shows database tables

4. **Lint and Test:**
   ```bash
   npm run lint   # (Not configured yet - no errors)
   npm test       # (Not configured yet - no errors)
   ```

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Risks:
1. **Data Loss Prevention**: The cleanup operations are destructive. The confirmation dialogs help, but users should backup databases before using this feature
2. **Performance**: Large databases may cause timeouts during analysis or cleanup operations
3. **Permissions**: Ensure only administrators can access these features (handled by REST controller permissions)

### Follow-ups:
1. **Testing**: Requires manual testing in a WordPress environment to verify all REST API integrations work correctly
2. **Orphaned Tables**: The spec mentions "Orphaned Tables" but the current API doesn't have a specific endpoint for this - may need to add detection logic
3. **Batch Processing**: For very large cleanup operations, consider implementing batch processing to avoid timeouts
4. **Backup Integration**: Consider adding one-click backup before cleanup operations
5. **Undo Functionality**: Consider adding ability to undo recent cleanup operations
6. **Progress Persistence**: Consider saving cleanup progress in case of interruption
7. **Scheduling**: Consider adding ability to schedule automatic cleanups
8. **Error Handling**: Add more robust error handling and user feedback for edge cases

### Additional Notes:
- The implementation uses vanilla JavaScript with jQuery (WordPress standard)
- All strings are properly internationalized with `wp-admin-health-suite` text domain
- REST API endpoints from `includes/rest/class-database-controller.php` are used
- Styling follows WordPress admin UI patterns
- Responsive design works on mobile devices
