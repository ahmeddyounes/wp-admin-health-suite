The task is complete. Let me provide the final summary.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Updated `docs/test-coverage-gap-analysis.md` with a comprehensive integration test review section (+237 lines). The document now includes:

### New Sections Added:
1. **Section 8: Integration Test Review** - Complete analysis of `tests/integration/RestApiTest.php`
   - Assessment of existing test coverage (authentication, permissions, nonce verification, rate limiting)
   - REST controller endpoint gap analysis for:
     - DatabaseController (6 endpoints, 2 critical gaps)
     - MediaController (7 endpoints, 2 critical gaps)
     - PerformanceController (5 endpoints, all missing)
     - DashboardController (3 endpoints, partial coverage)
     - ActivityController (2 endpoints, no coverage)
   - Testing patterns assessment with strengths and improvement areas
   - Missing integration test file recommendations
   - Estimated effort for ~61 new integration test methods

2. **Section 9: Combined Test Priority Matrix** - Unified priority ranking across both unit and integration tests

3. **Section 10: Updated Conclusion** - Summary identifying total test gap:
   - Unit tests: ~84 test methods needed
   - Integration tests: ~61 test methods needed
   - **Grand total: ~145 new test methods**

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 pass)
npm test

# Review the updated document
cat docs/test-coverage-gap-analysis.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **No code changes** - This was a documentation-only task reviewing test coverage gaps
2. **Follow-up work identified** - The analysis identifies 6 new integration test files that should be created:
   - `tests/integration/DatabaseCleanupTest.php` (Critical)
   - `tests/integration/MediaOperationsTest.php` (Critical)
   - `tests/integration/PerformanceEndpointsTest.php` (Critical)
   - `tests/integration/RateLimitingTest.php` (High)
   - `tests/integration/SafeModeTest.php` (High)
   - `tests/integration/ActivityLoggingTest.php` (Medium)
3. **Priority recommendation** - POST/DELETE endpoint tests should be prioritized as they modify data and have zero current coverage
