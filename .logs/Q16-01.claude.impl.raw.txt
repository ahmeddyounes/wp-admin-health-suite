These should be created and added before plugin directory submission\n\n3. **WordPress Version**: Updated \"Tested up to\" to 6.7 - this should be verified by actually testing on WordPress 6.7 before publishing\n\n4. **REST API Endpoints**: The README includes a REST API table. These endpoints should be verified against actual implementation to ensure accuracy","session_id":"892baa75-00b2-4446-ad2d-ac4d13c36721","total_cost_usd":1.2885799999999998,"usage":{"input_tokens":19757,"cache_creation_input_tokens":89158,"cache_read_input_tokens":853887,"output_tokens":7498,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":89158}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":19757,"outputTokens":7498,"cacheReadInputTokens":853887,"cacheCreationInputTokens":89158,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.270416,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":17744,"outputTokens":84,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.018164,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"59584f03-ac56-43e2-8d71-087a5c855edf"}
