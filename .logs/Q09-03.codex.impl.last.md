Status: DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Expanded Elementor meta scanning to include `_elementor_page_settings` (covers template/page-level settings media) in `includes/Integrations/Elementor.php:41`.
- Hardened attachment-ID detection by using broader *strict* LIKE patterns (numeric + quoted + serialized) plus verification via parsing in `includes/Integrations/Elementor.php:332`.
- Added dynamic-content support: detects IDs inside `__dynamic__` values (JSON blobs stored as escaped strings) via a targeted fallback scan and also includes these in `get_attachment_usage()` results in `includes/Integrations/Elementor.php:1035`.
- Improved parsing to recurse into nested JSON/serialized strings so dynamic/tagged values are detected during extraction/context discovery in `includes/Integrations/Elementor.php:491`.

**How to verify**
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

**Risks / follow-ups**
- Dynamic fallback scan is keyed off `__dynamic__` and has a safety cap (20×50 meta rows); extremely large sites could hit the cap and miss edge cases (it logs a batch-limit warning).
- `npm run lint` currently reports warnings (no errors); unrelated to this task but could be addressed separately.
