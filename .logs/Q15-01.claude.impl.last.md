## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created comprehensive test coverage gap analysis document at `docs/test-coverage-gap-analysis.md` that:

1. **Analyzed existing test coverage** across Database, Media, and Performance modules
2. **Identified critical gaps**:
   - **Performance Module**: CRITICAL - Zero tests for 7 classes (AutoloadAnalyzer, CacheChecker, PluginProfiler, QueryMonitor, AjaxMonitor, HeartbeatController, PerformanceCheckTask)
   - **Database Module**: HIGH priority - Missing TrashCleaner (11 tests) and OrphanedTables (7 tests)
   - **Media Module**: HIGH priority - Missing DuplicateDetector (12 tests) and AltTextChecker (11 tests)

3. **Documented 84+ specific test scenarios** needed across all modules
4. **Created priority matrix** with 10 ranked items
5. **Provided actionable recommendations** for immediate, short-term, and medium-term actions

## How to Verify

```bash
# View the analysis document
cat docs/test-coverage-gap-analysis.md

# Run verification commands
npm run lint    # 0 errors, 161 warnings (pre-existing)
npm test        # All tests pass
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **CRITICAL**: Performance module has zero test coverage - any changes to AutoloadAnalyzer, CacheChecker, or PluginProfiler could introduce regressions undetected
2. **HIGH**: TrashCleaner handles permanent deletion of posts/comments - untested deletion logic poses data loss risk
3. **HIGH**: DuplicateDetector memory handling is untested - could cause site crashes on large media libraries
4. **MEDIUM**: OrphanedTables drop functionality could accidentally drop active tables without tests
5. **Recommended next task**: Implement AutoloadAnalyzerTest.php as first priority to cover the most critical gap
