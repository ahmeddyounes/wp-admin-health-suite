Both verification commands pass:

- **Tests**: 13 test suites, 417 tests all passed

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**
- Created comprehensive PHPCS configuration review document at `docs/phpcs-configuration-review.md`
- Document covers:
  - WordPress Coding Standards compliance analysis (WordPress-Extra, WordPress-Docs, PHPCompatibilityWP)
  - Custom sniff exclusion justifications (7 WordPress-Extra exclusions, 5 WordPress-Docs exclusions)
  - Excluded paths analysis with justifications
  - Current PHPCS status with 21 errors across 9 files
  - Detailed error categorization and fix recommendations
  - Path coverage gap (templates directory not scanned)
  - Version mismatch finding (phpcs.xml has WP 5.8, plugin requires 6.0)
  - Configuration quality score: 8.4/10
  - Priority-ranked recommendations

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Lint passes (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Tests pass
npm test

# View the new review document
cat docs/phpcs-configuration-review.md
```

**Risks / Follow-ups:**
1. **Templates directory not scanned** - 57 errors exist in templates/ that aren't being caught by CI. Consider adding `<file>templates</file>` to phpcs.xml.
2. **WordPress version mismatch** - phpcs.xml has `minimum_wp_version` as 5.8 but plugin header requires 6.0. Should update to 6.0 for consistency.
3. **21 PHPCS errors in codebase** - These should be fixed to achieve clean PHPCS runs. The review document categorizes them by priority.
4. **Documentation exclusions** - Two WordPress-Docs sniffs are excluded (`MissingParamTag`, `MissingShort`) which may reduce documentation quality.
