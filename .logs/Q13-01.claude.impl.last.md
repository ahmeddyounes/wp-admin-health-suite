**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Reviewed `assets/css/admin.css` for WordPress admin integration, proper specificity, responsive design, and dark mode compatibility.

### Analysis Results
1. **WordPress Admin Integration** ✅ - Well integrated with WordPress admin color schemes via body class selectors, proper z-index layering, and WordPress breakpoints (782px, 600px)
2. **CSS Specificity** ✅ - Follows good practices with consistent `wpha-` namespace, flat selectors, and CSS variables for theming
3. **Responsive Design** ✅ - Properly implemented with WordPress admin breakpoints and appropriate stacking on smaller screens
4. **Dark Mode** ⚠️ Fixed - Found and fixed issues with hardcoded alert background colors

### Changes Made
1. **Added CSS variable for alert backgrounds in light mode** (lines 56-60):
   - `--wpha-alert-success-bg`, `--wpha-alert-warning-bg`, `--wpha-alert-error-bg`, `--wpha-alert-info-bg`

2. **Enhanced dark mode support** (lines 76-86):
   - Added adjusted status colors for dark backgrounds
   - Added dark mode alert background colors using rgba for transparency

3. **Updated alert styles** (lines 1007-1041):
   - Changed hardcoded colors to use CSS variables for dark mode compatibility

## How to Verify

```bash
npm run lint   # Should pass with only warnings (no errors)
npm test       # Should pass all 417 tests
```

Manual verification: Open the CSS file and check lines 56-86 and 1007-1041 for the updates.

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Dark mode not yet active in WordPress** - WordPress core doesn't currently have a `.is-dark-theme` class. The CSS is prepared for future compatibility when/if WordPress adds dark mode support.

2. **Consider adding standalone dark mode support** - Currently requires both `prefers-color-scheme: dark` AND `.is-dark-theme` class. A future enhancement could add a manual toggle or separate class for users who want dark mode regardless of system settings.
