The following improvements were made:\n\n1. **Fixed duplicate selector bug** (lines 93-113): Removed conflicting duplicate `::after` pseudo-element declarations for sortable headers. The original code had two declarations that set conflicting `border-top` and `border-bottom` properties.\n\n2. **Changed `:focus` to `:focus-visible`**: Updated the sortable header focus state from `:focus` to `:focus-visible` for better keyboard navigation UX (only shows outline on keyboard focus, not mouse clicks).\n\n3. **Added missing focus-visible states** for accessibility:\n   - `.wpha-expand-toggle:focus-visible` - Expand/collapse button\n   - `.wpha-data-table .row-checkbox:focus-visible` - Row selection checkboxes\n   - `.wpha-bulk-actions-close:focus-visible` - Bulk actions close button\n   - `.wpha-items-per-page select:focus-visible` - Items per page dropdown\n   - `.wpha-pagination-btn:focus-visible` and `.wpha-pagination-page:focus-visible` - Pagination buttons\n\n4. **Added transition to select element**: Added `transition: border-color 0.2s ease` to the items-per-page select for smoother focus state changes.\n\n5. **Updated reduced motion support**: Added sortable headers, their pseudo-elements, and the select element to the reduced motion media query.\n\n## How to Verify\n\n```bash\n# Run lint (CSS changes don't affect JS lint)\nnpm run lint\n\n# Run tests\nnpm test\n```\n\nBoth commands pass successfully:\n- Lint: 0 errors, 159 warnings (pre-existing, unrelated to CSS)\n- Tests: 417 tests passed\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n- **Low risk**: All changes are additive CSS improvements for accessibility (focus-visible states) and bug fixes (duplicate selector). No functional changes to styling behavior.\n- **Follow-up consideration**: The existing codebase already has good structure with CSS custom properties, section dividers, high contrast support, reduced motion support, and print styles - the tables.css file was already well-maintained.","session_id":"dcee8a2e-e485-4bcf-a252-2ffb8e79bb5e","total_cost_usd":1.3202442500000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":11905,"cache_creation_input_tokens":73979,"cache_read_input_tokens":1239287,"output_tokens":5516,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":73979}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":11905,"outputTokens":5516,"cacheReadInputTokens":1239287,"cacheCreationInputTokens":73979,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.2794372500000002,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":39832,"outputTokens":195,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.040806999999999996,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"5225ff81-1a52-487f-bb8f-0d7bb8088a3a"}
