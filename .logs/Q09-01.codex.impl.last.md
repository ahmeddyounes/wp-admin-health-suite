Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Updated `includes/Integrations/IntegrationManager.php` to safely replace duplicate registrations (deactivate old integration + deindex its capabilities) instead of throwing.
- Fixed built-in ACF integration discovery by using the `Acf` class casing so it autoloads correctly.
- Made capability discovery return only **available + compatible** integrations, and auto-run `discover()` when needed.
- Hardened `init()` to (a) skip integrations with unmet dependencies, (b) catch circular dependency failures and fall back to priority sort, and (c) catch `\Throwable` during discovery/init.

How to verify (exact commands):
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups:
- `get_by_capability()` now returns an ID-keyed array and filters out unavailable/incompatible integrations; adjust any future callers expecting the old behavior.
- Consider normalizing ACF file/class casing (`Acf.php` vs `ACF`) to avoid autoload surprises on case-sensitive filesystems.
- `npm run lint` still reports pre-existing warnings (no errors).
