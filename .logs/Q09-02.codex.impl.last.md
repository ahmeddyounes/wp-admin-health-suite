Status: DONE

**Summary of changes**
- `includes/Media/Scanner.php:531`: Removed hard-coded WooCommerce gallery / Elementor checks and now defer plugin-specific “attachment used” detection to `wpha_media_is_attachment_used`.
- `includes/Integrations/WooCommerce.php:96`: Improved WooCommerce version detection with a `WC()->version` fallback when `WC_VERSION` isn’t defined.
- `includes/Integrations/WooCommerce.php:408`: Added WooCommerce product category thumbnail detection (`thumbnail_id` in term meta, plus legacy `woocommerce_termmeta` support).
- `includes/Integrations/WooCommerce.php:801`: Included category thumbnail IDs in `get_used_attachments()` and surfaced category thumbnail usage in `get_attachment_usage()`.

**How to verify**
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

**Risks / follow-ups**
- WooCommerce gallery / Elementor / ACF usage is now detected via integrations only; if those plugins are inactive or below the integration min-version, their references won’t count as “used”.
- `wpha_slow_query_threshold` is still unused by the query monitor; wire it in if you want WooCommerce-specific thresholds to apply.
