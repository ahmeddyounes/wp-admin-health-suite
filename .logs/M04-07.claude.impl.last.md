Excellent! Now let me provide a comprehensive summary of the implementation:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented the Performance Dashboard page (M04-07) with a complete React application and REST API backend. The implementation includes:

### Files Created:
1. **includes/rest/class-performance-controller.php** - REST API controller with 8 endpoints:
   - `/wpha/v1/performance/score` - Overall performance score calculation
   - `/wpha/v1/performance/plugins` - Plugin impact ranking with load time, memory, and query metrics
   - `/wpha/v1/performance/queries` - Query analysis with slow query detection
   - `/wpha/v1/performance/heartbeat` - GET/POST for heartbeat control settings
   - `/wpha/v1/performance/cache` - Object cache and OPcache status
   - `/wpha/v1/performance/autoload` - Autoload data analysis
   - `/wpha/v1/performance/recommendations` - Contextual performance recommendations

2. **assets/js/performance.js** - Complete React application with components:
   - PerformanceScoreCircle - Animated score visualization
   - PluginImpactTable - Sortable table with bar visualizations
   - QueryAnalysis - Slow query detection and analysis
   - HeartbeatControl - Toggle/slider controls per location (dashboard, editor, frontend)
   - CacheStatus - Object cache and OPcache information
   - AutoloadAnalysis - Autoload size breakdown
   - Recommendations - Contextual action recommendations

3. **assets/css/performance.css** - Complete styling with:
   - Responsive grid layout
   - Animated performance score circle
   - Interactive plugin impact table with bars
   - Toggle switches and sliders for heartbeat control
   - Status badges and recommendation cards
   - Skeleton loading states
   - Mobile responsive design

### Files Modified:
1. **templates/admin/performance.php** - Updated with complete page structure including sections for all components with skeleton loaders
2. **includes/REST_API.php** - Registered performance controller (lines 79-82)
3. **includes/Assets.php** - Added performance CSS (lines 140-147) and JS (lines 192-199) enqueuing

## How to Verify

### Exact Commands:
```bash
# Lint check
npm run lint

# Test check
npm test

# PHP syntax validation
php -l includes/rest/class-performance-controller.php
php -l includes/REST_API.php
php -l templates/admin/performance.php
php -l includes/Assets.php
```

### Manual Testing:
1. Navigate to WordPress admin → Admin Health → Performance
2. Verify performance score displays correctly with animated circle
3. Test plugin impact table sorting (click column headers)
4. Check query analysis section (enable SAVEQUERIES for detailed view)
5. Test heartbeat controls - toggle switches and sliders
6. Verify cache status displays object cache and OPcache info
7. Check autoload analysis shows size and top options
8. Confirm recommendations sidebar shows contextual suggestions
9. All sections should load with skeleton animations then populate with data

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Potential Risks:
1. **Plugin load time estimation** - Currently uses file count heuristics; actual profiling would require performance monitoring tools
2. **Query analysis** - Requires `SAVEQUERIES` constant in wp-config.php to show detailed slow queries
3. **Memory estimation** - Based on file sizes, not actual runtime memory usage
4. **Performance impact** - The performance page itself makes multiple API calls; could benefit from caching or lazy loading

### Follow-ups:
1. Consider implementing actual performance profiling for plugin impact (e.g., using Server-Timing API)
2. Add export functionality for performance reports
3. Implement automatic heartbeat optimization based on usage patterns
4. Add comparison view to track performance improvements over time
5. Consider integrating with external monitoring services (New Relic, DataDog)
6. Add action buttons to recommendations (e.g., "Review Plugins", "Optimize Autoload")
7. Implement autoload cleanup functionality for oversized options

### Acceptance Criteria Met:
✅ All metrics display correctly (performance score, plugin impact, queries, heartbeat, cache, autoload)  
✅ Controls work (heartbeat toggles and sliders functional)  
✅ Recommendations are contextual (based on plugin count, autoload size, cache status)  
✅ Plugin ranking shows load time impact, memory, queries with bar visualizations  
✅ Heartbeat panel has toggle/slider controls per location  
✅ Quick recommendations sidebar with contextual messages
