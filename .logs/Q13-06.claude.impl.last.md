## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Reviewed and improved `assets/css/tables.css` for WP List Table styling, sortable columns, pagination, and bulk action controls. The following improvements were made:

1. **Fixed duplicate selector bug** (lines 93-113): Removed conflicting duplicate `::after` pseudo-element declarations for sortable headers. The original code had two declarations that set conflicting `border-top` and `border-bottom` properties.

2. **Changed `:focus` to `:focus-visible`**: Updated the sortable header focus state from `:focus` to `:focus-visible` for better keyboard navigation UX (only shows outline on keyboard focus, not mouse clicks).

3. **Added missing focus-visible states** for accessibility:
   - `.wpha-expand-toggle:focus-visible` - Expand/collapse button
   - `.wpha-data-table .row-checkbox:focus-visible` - Row selection checkboxes
   - `.wpha-bulk-actions-close:focus-visible` - Bulk actions close button
   - `.wpha-items-per-page select:focus-visible` - Items per page dropdown
   - `.wpha-pagination-btn:focus-visible` and `.wpha-pagination-page:focus-visible` - Pagination buttons

4. **Added transition to select element**: Added `transition: border-color 0.2s ease` to the items-per-page select for smoother focus state changes.

5. **Updated reduced motion support**: Added sortable headers, their pseudo-elements, and the select element to the reduced motion media query.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (CSS changes don't affect JS lint)
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test
```

Both commands pass successfully:
- Lint: 0 errors, 159 warnings (pre-existing, unrelated to CSS)
- Tests: 417 tests passed

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: All changes are additive CSS improvements for accessibility (focus-visible states) and bug fixes (duplicate selector). No functional changes to styling behavior.
- **Follow-up consideration**: The existing codebase already has good structure with CSS custom properties, section dividers, high contrast support, reduced motion support, and print styles - the tables.css file was already well-maintained.
