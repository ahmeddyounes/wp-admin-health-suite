Any existing code calling these methods without the parameter will receive a `requires_confirm` response instead of executing. This is intentional for safety but may require updates to REST endpoints or frontend code that calls these methods.\n\n2. **No actual rollback capability**: The rollback mechanism stores metadata for audit purposes only. Most database cleanup operations (deleting spam comments, revisions, transients) are permanent and cannot be rolled back. Only table optimization is marked as reversible. Users should be aware that deleted data cannot be recovered without a database backup.\n\n3. **Consider adding REST endpoint**: The `OneClickFix` class is registered in the container but not yet exposed via REST API. A future task should add a REST controller with proper nonce verification and capability checks to expose these methods to the frontend.","session_id":"d2b2cebe-1c47-47dd-85b6-697dc6070ae7","total_cost_usd":2.1863409999999996,"usage":{"input_tokens":973,"cache_creation_input_tokens":71052,"cache_read_input_tokens":2746848,"output_tokens":13619,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":71052}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":973,"outputTokens":13619,"cacheReadInputTokens":2746848,"cacheCreationInputTokens":71052,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":2.162839,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":21732,"outputTokens":354,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.023501999999999995,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"e013e1de-3d1d-4058-88c6-138f7096ffcd"}
