The implementation is complete. Let me provide a summary.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

- Documented that this class is no longer instantiated by the plugin

- Pointed users to `RESTServiceProvider` as the replacement

**`includes/Database.php`**
- Added `@deprecated 1.3.0` annotations to both file header and class docblock

- Pointed users to `DatabaseServiceProvider` and related service classes as replacements

### 2. Updated CHANGELOG.md

- Added `[Unreleased]` section with `### Deprecated` subsection
- Listed both deprecated classes with explanation of what replaced them

### 3. Updated Hooks Documentation (`docs/developers/hooks.md`)

- Marked `wpha_rest_api_init` as deprecated with migration example
- Marked `wpha_register_rest_routes` as deprecated with migration example  
- Marked `wpha_database_init` as deprecated with migration example
- Updated `wpha_dependencies_loaded` example to use modern class path

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (should pass with only pre-existing warnings)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all should pass)
npm test

# Check deprecation annotations
grep -n "@deprecated" includes/RestApi.php includes/Database.php

# Check CHANGELOG entries
head -20 CHANGELOG.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Low Risk**: The deprecated classes are still available for any third-party code that may have extended or instantiated them directly. The files are kept for backward compatibility.

2. **Future Removal**: These files should be removed in a future major version (e.g., 2.0.0) after proper deprecation notice period.

3. **Hook Migration**: Any third-party code using `wpha_rest_api_init`, `wpha_register_rest_routes`, or `wpha_database_init` hooks will need to migrate to the WordPress `rest_api_init` action or `wpha_init` action. The documentation provides migration examples.

4. **C03-10 Follow-up**: Plan task C03-10 mentions converting `RestApi.php` into a thin wrapper if it needs to remain for compatibility. Since we've confirmed it's unused, this task may be simplified or skipped.
