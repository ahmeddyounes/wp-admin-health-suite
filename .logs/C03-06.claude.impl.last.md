**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Replaced per-controller `log_activity()` implementations with centralized `ActivityLoggerInterface` usage across 4 controllers:

### Controllers Updated:
1. **MediaController.php** (`includes/REST/MediaController.php`)
   - Added `ActivityLoggerInterface` dependency (nullable, optional)
   - Replaced private `log_activity()` method with `$this->activity_logger->log_media_operation()`

2. **MediaCleanupController.php** (`includes/REST/Media/MediaCleanupController.php`)
   - Added `ActivityLoggerInterface` dependency (nullable, optional)
   - Replaced private `log_activity()` method with `$this->activity_logger->log_media_operation()`

3. **CleanupController.php** (`includes/REST/Database/CleanupController.php`)
   - Added `ActivityLoggerInterface` dependency (nullable, optional)
   - Replaced private `log_activity()` method with `$this->activity_logger->log_database_cleanup()`

4. **OptimizationController.php** (`includes/REST/Database/OptimizationController.php`)
   - Added `ActivityLoggerInterface` dependency (nullable, optional)
   - Replaced private `log_activity()` method with `$this->activity_logger->log_database_cleanup()`

### Service Provider Updated:
- **RESTServiceProvider.php** (`includes/Providers/RESTServiceProvider.php`)
  - Updated bindings for all 4 controllers to inject `ActivityLoggerInterface`
  - Uses try-catch pattern for optional dependency (consistent with existing RunScan, RunHealthCheck, etc.)

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint (passes with warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Backward compatibility**: The `ActivityLoggerInterface` is injected as nullable (`?ActivityLoggerInterface`) with null checks before calling logging methods, so controllers remain functional even if the logger is not available.

2. **Table existence caching**: The centralized `ActivityLogger` implementation already includes cached table existence checks via `$table_exists_cache` property, ensuring consistent and performant scan history behavior across all controllers.

3. **No behavioral changes**: The logging functionality remains the same - only the implementation location has changed from duplicated per-controller methods to the centralized service.
