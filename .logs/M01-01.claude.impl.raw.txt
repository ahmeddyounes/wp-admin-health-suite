Here's what was created:\n\n### 1. **Dashboard Template** (`templates/admin/dashboard.php`)\n   - Created a comprehensive dashboard layout with React mount point\n   - **Header Section**: Large animated health score circle (200px) with SVG-based circular progress indicator\n   - **Metrics Cards Row**: 4 metric cards displaying:\n     - Database Size (with database icon)\n     - Media Files (with image icon)\n     - Active Plugins (with plugins icon)\n     - Last Cleanup (with update icon)\n   - **Main Content Grid**: Two-column layout featuring:\n     - Recent Activity timeline section\n     - Quick Actions grid section\n   - **React Mount Point**: `#wpha-dashboard-root` div for future React components\n   - **Skeleton Loaders**: Added to all sections for async data loading states\n\n### 2. **Dashboard Styles** (`assets/css/dashboard.css`)\n   - **CSS Grid Layout**: Responsive grid system for all dashboard sections\n   - **Responsive Design**: \n     - Breakpoint at 782px (WordPress admin standard)\n     - Additional breakpoint at 600px for very small screens\n     - Metrics cards: 4 columns → 2 columns → 1 column\n     - Dashboard grid: 2 columns → 1 column on mobile\n   - **WordPress Admin Color Scheme Compatibility**: Support for Fresh, Light, Modern, Blue, and Midnight color schemes\n   - **Animated Health Score**: SVG circle with CSS animation and custom properties\n   - **Skeleton Loaders**: Gradient-based loading animations for all async content areas\n   - **WordPress Admin Aesthetic**: Uses WordPress admin colors (#c3c4c7, #2271b1, #f6f7f7) and dashicons\n\n## How to Verify\n\nRun these commands:\n```bash\nnpm run lint   # No linting configured yet (passes)\nnpm test       # No tests configured yet (passes)\n```\n\nTo verify the implementation manually:\n1. Activate the plugin in a WordPress installation\n2. Navigate to **Admin Health** → **Dashboard** in the WordPress admin\n3. Verify the layout displays correctly with:\n   - Centered health score circle at the top\n   - 4 metric cards in a row below\n   - Recent Activity and Quick Actions sections in a grid\n   - Skeleton loaders visible initially\n4. Test responsive design by resizing browser to < 782px and < 600px\n5. Verify it matches WordPress admin aesthetic (colors, spacing, borders)\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n**Risks:**\n- None - This is a pure template and CSS implementation with no security concerns\n- Static placeholders (\"--\") will need to be replaced when React components are implemented\n\n**Follow-ups:**\n1. Implement React components to populate the dashboard with actual data\n2. Connect to REST API endpoints for fetching health metrics\n3. Implement the health score calculation logic\n4. Add interactive functionality to Quick Actions buttons\n5. Populate Recent Activity timeline with actual WordPress events\n6. Add animations and transitions when data loads (hide skeleton loaders)","session_id":"d169bc7a-50ce-4acc-b9aa-967af22c7a3e","total_cost_usd":0.3838418499999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":3839,"cache_creation_input_tokens":25577,"cache_read_input_tokens":480827,"output_tokens":8538,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":25577}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":3353,"outputTokens":148,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.004092999999999999,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":3839,"outputTokens":8538,"cacheReadInputTokens":480827,"cacheCreationInputTokens":25577,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.3797488499999999,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"5e7f62b1-a723-4355-bab0-b79fd33ea1c1"}
