The implementation is complete.

## Summary

**Status: DONE**

### Summary of Changes

Refactored `includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php` to use `SchedulingService` for settings-driven rescheduling:

1. **Added import**: Added `use WPAdminHealth\Scheduler\Contracts\SchedulingServiceInterface;` at the top of the file (line 15).

2. **Simplified `handle_scheduling_update()` method** (lines 834-853): 
   - Replaced 68 lines of complex scheduling logic with a simple delegation to `SchedulingService::reconcile()`
   - The `reconcile()` method handles all scheduling scenarios:
     - Unschedules all tasks when `scheduler_enabled` is false
     - Unschedules individual tasks when their `enable_*` setting is false
     - Reschedules tasks when their frequency changes
     - Uses `preferred_time` setting for calculating next run times

3. **Removed unused private methods** (106 lines removed):
   - `schedule_task()` - now handled by `SchedulingService::schedule()`
   - `unschedule_task()` - now handled by `SchedulingService::unschedule()`
   - `unschedule_all_tasks()` - now handled by `SchedulingService::unschedule_all()`
   - `calculate_next_run_time()` - now handled by `SchedulingService::calculate_next_run_time()`
   - `get_interval_seconds()` - now handled internally by `SchedulingService`
   - `get_cron_schedule_name()` - now handled internally by `SchedulingService`

### How to Verify

```bash
# Run linting (should pass with only warnings, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run JS tests (all 417 tests should pass)
npm test

# Run PHP standalone tests (SchedulingService tests)
php ./vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml tests/unit-standalone/Scheduler/SchedulingServiceTest.php
```

### Risks / Follow-ups

1. **No new tests added**: The existing `SchedulingServiceTest` tests cover the `reconcile()` method behavior comprehensively. However, integration tests for `SettingsServiceProvider::handle_scheduling_update()` with a mocked container would provide additional confidence.

2. **Graceful degradation**: The code checks if `SchedulingServiceInterface` is available in the container before calling it. If the service is not registered (unlikely in normal operation), the handler returns early without performing any scheduling operations.

3. **Hook fire behavior unchanged**: The `update_option_` hook still triggers `handle_scheduling_update()` on every settings save, and the `SchedulingService::reconcile()` method efficiently determines which tasks need changes.
