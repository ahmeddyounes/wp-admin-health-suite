**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Created `includes/Admin/AdminMenu.php`** - A new autoloaded class under the `WPAdminHealth\Admin` namespace that contains all the admin menu registration logic previously in `admin/Admin.php`. This class:
   - Registers the top-level menu and submenus (Dashboard, Database Health, Media Audit, Performance, Settings)
   - Handles admin body class addition
   - Renders admin page templates

2. **Created `includes/Admin/index.php`** - Standard WordPress silence-is-golden file for security.

3. **Updated `includes/Admin.php`** - Refactored to:
   - Import `WPAdminHealth\Admin\AdminMenu` via `use` statement
   - Remove the `require_once` call to `admin/Admin.php`
   - Instantiate `AdminMenu` through the autoloader
   - Added a `get_admin_menu()` accessor method
   - Added PHP 7.4+ type declarations

The old `admin/Admin.php` file remains in place but is no longer used - it can be removed in a future cleanup task.

**How to verify:**

```bash
# Run ESLint (JS)
npm run lint

# Run Jest tests
npm test

# Run PHP CodeSniffer on the new/modified files
vendor/bin/phpcs includes/Admin/AdminMenu.php includes/Admin.php
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**

1. **Cleanup:** The `admin/Admin.php` file is now orphaned and should be removed in a future task (e.g., part of a larger cleanup effort).
2. **Backwards compatibility:** If any external code was referencing `\WPAdminHealth\Admin\Admin` from the old location, it will break. However, since the class was instantiated privately via `require_once`, external references are unlikely.
