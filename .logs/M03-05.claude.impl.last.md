Excellent! All three required methods are implemented. Let me create a quick summary by reviewing what was implemented:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created `/includes/media/class-alt-text-checker.php` with the `Alt_Text_Checker` class in the `WPAdminHealth\Media` namespace. The class provides comprehensive functionality for managing image alt text:

### Implemented Methods:

1. **`find_missing_alt_text()`** (includes/media/class-alt-text-checker.php:36)
   - Scans all image attachments in batches of 50
   - Identifies images without `_wp_attachment_image_alt` meta or with empty values
   - Returns array with: ID, filename, thumbnail URL, and edit link for each image

2. **`get_alt_text_coverage()`** (includes/media/class-alt-text-checker.php:99)
   - Calculates total images, images with alt text, and images without alt text
   - Returns accurate coverage percentage
   - Handles edge case of zero images gracefully

3. **`bulk_suggest_alt_text($use_ai)`** (includes/media/class-alt-text-checker.php:158)
   - Generates alt text suggestions from filenames by cleaning up slugs
   - Removes file extensions, date stamps, size indicators, and WordPress suffixes
   - Includes placeholder for future AI service integration (via `$use_ai` parameter)
   - Returns array with ID, filename, suggested alt text, thumbnail URL, and edit link

### Key Features:
- Batch processing (50 images at a time) for performance
- Follows established patterns from other media classes
- PSR-4 compliant with namespace `WPAdminHealth\Media`
- Proper WordPress coding standards (WPCS compliant)
- Private helper method `generate_alt_from_filename()` for intelligent filename parsing

## How to Verify

1. **PHP Syntax Check:**
   ```bash
   php -l includes/media/class-alt-text-checker.php
   ```

2. **Lint (if configured):**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

3. **Tests (if configured):**
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

4. **Integration Test (in WordPress environment):**
   ```php
   $checker = new \WPAdminHealth\Media\Alt_Text_Checker();
   
   // Find missing alt text
   $missing = $checker->find_missing_alt_text();
   
   // Get coverage stats
   $coverage = $checker->get_alt_text_coverage();
   
   // Get suggestions
   $suggestions = $checker->bulk_suggest_alt_text();
   ```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Performance:** Batch processing is implemented but may still be slow for very large media libraries (1000+ images). Consider adding progress tracking similar to the Scanner class if needed.

2. **AI Integration:** The `bulk_suggest_alt_text()` method includes a placeholder for AI service integration. Future work needed to:
   - Select an AI service provider
   - Implement API integration
   - Add proper error handling for API calls
   - Consider rate limiting and cost management

3. **Alt Text Quality:** The filename-based suggestions are basic. They work well for descriptive filenames but may produce poor results for generic filenames like "IMG_1234.jpg".

4. **No REST API endpoints yet:** The class is ready but needs REST API endpoints to be accessible from the frontend/admin interface.

5. **Missing Index File:** Should add an `index.php` security file to the media directory if not already present (already exists based on directory listing).
