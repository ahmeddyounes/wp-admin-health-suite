## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

The `composer.json` file had redundant `classmap` entries in the `autoload` section that:

1. **Were case-mismatched**: The classmap paths used lowercase (`includes/database/`, `includes/rest/`, `includes/integrations/`, `includes/media/`, `includes/performance/`, `includes/ai/`) while the actual filesystem directories use PascalCase (`Database/`, `REST/`, `Integrations/`, `Media/`, `Performance/`, `AI/`)

2. **Were redundant**: The PSR-4 autoload entry `"WPAdminHealth\\": "includes/"` already covers all classes under `includes/`, making the explicit classmap entries unnecessary

**Change made**: Removed the redundant classmap section from `autoload` (lines 28-34 in the original), leaving only the PSR-4 configuration.

**Before:**
```json
"autoload": {
  "psr-4": {
    "WPAdminHealth\\": "includes/"
  },
  "classmap": [
    "includes/database/",
    "includes/integrations/",
    "includes/media/",
    "includes/rest/",
    "includes/performance/",
    "includes/ai/"
  ]
}
```

**After:**
```json
"autoload": {
  "psr-4": {
    "WPAdminHealth\\": "includes/"
  }
}
```

## How to Verify

```bash
# Regenerate autoload classmap and verify no errors
composer dump-autoload -o

# Check classmap has correct paths (should show uppercase directory names)
grep "includes/REST\|includes/Database\|includes/AI" vendor/composer/autoload_classmap.php

# Run linting (warnings are acceptable, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 should pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: The change simply removes redundant entries that were also incorrectly cased. PSR-4 autoloading handles all classes correctly.
- **Vendor warnings**: `composer dump-autoload` shows warnings about `League\Flysystem\FilesystemInterface` ambiguity from dev dependencies (phpdocumentor vs league/flysystem) - this is unrelated to our changes and is a known issue with the documentation generator.
- The `autoload-dev` classmap for `tests/` directories remains unchanged and appropriate since test directories may contain classes that don't follow PSR-4 conventions.
