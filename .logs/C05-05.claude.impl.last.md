Both lint (warnings only, no errors) and tests pass (443 tests passing). The project is in a working state.

## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

No code changes required. The spec C05-05 states "**If approved**, add TS toolchain..." but TypeScript migration was explicitly **NOT approved** per ADR-003 (Frontend Modernization Scope).

The ADR-003 decision explicitly states:
- "Do not adopt `@wordpress/data` stores, `@wordpress/components`, or migrate to TypeScript in the first iteration"
- TypeScript migration is listed under "Out of Scope (Non-Goals for First Iteration)"
- Rationale: PropTypes provide sufficient type safety for the current codebase size, migration effort would be 20-40 hours minimum with limited benefit

The handoff document was updated to document this decision and reference ADR-003.

## How to verify

```bash
# Verify tests pass
npm test

# Verify linting passes (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Review the decision document
cat docs/decisions/ADR-003-frontend-modernization-scope.md | grep -A 20 "TypeScript Migration"
```

## Risks / follow-ups

**None.** This was a conditional task that did not proceed because the precondition (TypeScript approval) was not met.

**Future consideration:** Per ADR-003, TypeScript can be revisited if:
- The codebase grows significantly
- Contributors specifically request it

If revisited in the future, the recommended approach is to "Start with API types (`.d.ts`) before full migration" rather than a big-bang conversion.
