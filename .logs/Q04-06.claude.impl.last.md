**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:**
- Fixed 4 PHPDoc blocks in `includes/Performance/AutoloadAnalyzer.php` with incorrect indentation (missing leading tabs on `@since` and blank lines)
- Fixed parameter alignment in the `change_autoload_status` method's PHPDoc (added extra space for consistent alignment with `$new_autoload`)

**How to verify:**
```bash
npm run lint               # Passes with warnings (pre-existing JS warnings)
npm test                   # All 101 tests pass
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse includes/Performance/AutoloadAnalyzer.php --memory-limit=1G  # No errors
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- None - these were cosmetic PHPDoc formatting fixes only
- The code logic was not changed
- The file passes phpstan at level 5 (project standard)
