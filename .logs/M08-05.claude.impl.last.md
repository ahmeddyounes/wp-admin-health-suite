Perfect! All required sections are present. Let me create a quick summary:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created comprehensive user documentation file `docs/performance.md` (46 KB, 1,445 lines) covering all required topics:

### Sections Implemented:

1. **Reading Plugin Impact Data** - Explains plugin profiling, impact scores, metrics (queries, memory, load time, assets), and how to interpret and act on high-impact plugins

2. **Heartbeat API Explained** - Comprehensive guide to WordPress Heartbeat, its performance impact, location-based control (admin/post-editor/frontend), frequency settings, presets (Default/Optimized/Minimal), and CPU savings estimation

3. **Query Optimization Basics** - Database query monitoring, slow query detection (50ms threshold), EXPLAIN analysis, duplicate query identification, missing index detection, and optimization techniques

4. **Object Cache Benefits** - Complete coverage of object caching types (Redis/Memcached/APCu/File-based), cache hit rate monitoring, performance benchmarking, and hosting-specific setup instructions for 12+ providers

5. **Autoload Options** - Autoload size analysis, problematic pattern detection (transients, sessions, cache), individual option management, size thresholds, and optimization recommendations

6. **Recommended Settings by Site Type** - Tailored configurations for 6 different site types:
   - Personal Blog / Small Business
   - Medium Business / Magazine
   - WooCommerce Store
   - Membership / LMS Site
   - High-Traffic News / Content
   - Multisite Network

7. **Performance Score Breakdown** - Detailed explanation of scoring formula (0-100), grade mapping (A-F), deduction calculations, improvement strategies, and real-world case studies

### Documentation Features:

- Consistent with existing docs style (getting-started.md, database-cleanup.md, media-audit.md)
- Comprehensive table of contents for easy navigation
- Code examples for REST API and programmatic usage
- Real-world scenarios and troubleshooting tips
- Screenshot placeholders for future visual aids
- Cross-references to other documentation files
- Best practices and "when NOT to" guidance
- Performance thresholds and benchmarks

## How to Verify

### File Verification:
```bash
# Check file exists and size
ls -lh docs/performance.md

# Verify line count (should be ~1,445 lines)
wc -l docs/performance.md

# Confirm all required sections
grep "^## " docs/performance.md
```

### Linting:
```bash
npm run lint
# Result: ✓ Passes (0 errors, 42 warnings - pre-existing)
```

### Testing:
```bash
npm test
# Result: ✓ Passes (no tests found, exits with code 0)
```

### Content Review:
```bash
# View the documentation
cat docs/performance.md

# Or open in your preferred markdown viewer
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk Items:
1. **Screenshot placeholders** - Documentation references screenshots in `./screenshots/` directory that should be added later for visual guidance
2. **Content accuracy** - Documentation is based on code analysis; should be reviewed by domain expert to ensure technical accuracy

### Follow-up Tasks:
1. Add screenshots referenced in the documentation:
   - `plugin-impact.png`
   - Various UI screenshots mentioned in sections
2. Consider adding a "Quick Start" or "TL;DR" section at the top for users who want immediate actionable steps
3. Update main README.md to link to this new performance.md documentation
4. Consider creating complementary video tutorials for complex topics (Heartbeat API, Object Cache setup)

### No Breaking Changes:
- This is pure documentation; no code changes
- No risk to existing functionality
- Enhances user understanding of existing features
