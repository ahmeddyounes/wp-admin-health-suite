## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

### New Files Created:
1. **`assets/js/components/ErrorBoundary.jsx`** - React Error Boundary class component that:
   - Catches JavaScript errors in child component tree
   - Provides customizable fallback UI with WordPress admin styling
   - Supports custom fallback prop (node or render function)
   - Triggers WordPress event (`componentError`) for integration
   - Includes "Try Again" reset functionality
   - Shows error details toggle in development mode
   - Accessible with `role="alert"` and proper ARIA attributes

2. **`assets/js/components/ErrorBoundary.test.jsx`** - Comprehensive test suite (14 tests) covering:
   - Normal rendering, error catching, fallback UI
   - Custom fallbacks, reset functionality, WordPress event triggering

3. **`assets/js/entries/dashboard.test.js`** - Entry point test suite (25 tests) covering:
   - Global component exposure on `window.WPAdminHealthComponents`
   - `withErrorBoundary` HOC utility
   - `mountComponent` and `unmountComponent` utilities
   - DOMContentLoaded initialization event

### Modified Files:
1. **`assets/js/entries/dashboard.js`** - Added:
   - ErrorBoundary import
   - `withErrorBoundary(Component, name)` HOC utility
   - `mountComponent(container, Component, props, name)` helper
   - `unmountComponent(root)` helper
   - DOMContentLoaded handler that triggers `dashboardInit` event
   - All utilities exposed on `window.WPAdminHealthComponents`

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run linting (should show 0 errors, only pre-existing warnings)
npm run lint

# Run tests (should show 214 tests passing)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Pre-existing lint warnings**: 159 warnings exist in other files (JSDoc types, prop-types). These are unrelated to this task.

2. **Consider adding ErrorBoundary to other entry points**: The ErrorBoundary and utilities are now available globally. Consider wrapping components in other pages (logs.js, database.js, performance.js) with ErrorBoundary for consistency.

3. **Error reporting integration**: The `componentError` event is triggered but requires `window.WPAdminHealth.Events` to be initialized. Ensure this is available before components mount in production.
