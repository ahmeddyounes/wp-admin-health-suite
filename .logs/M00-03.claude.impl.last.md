## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented the database schema and installation system for the WP Admin Health Suite plugin according to the M00-03 specification:

### Files Created:

1. **includes/class-installer.php** (lines 1-138)
   - Created `Installer` class with static methods for installation, upgrades, and uninstallation
   - Implements `install()` method that creates custom database tables using `dbDelta()`
   - Creates two tables with proper charset/collation:
     - `{prefix}wpha_scan_history` - tracks scan history with fields: id, scan_type, items_found, items_cleaned, bytes_freed, created_at
     - `{prefix}wpha_scheduled_tasks` - manages scheduled tasks with fields: id, task_type, frequency, last_run, next_run, status, settings (JSON stored as longtext)
   - Stores plugin version in options table using constant `wpha_version`
   - Implements `maybe_upgrade()` method that checks version and runs upgrade routine when needed
   - Provides `uninstall()` method that removes all tables and options

2. **uninstall.php** (lines 1-22)
   - WordPress uninstall script that runs when plugin is deleted
   - Only removes data when `WPHA_DELETE_PLUGIN_DATA` constant is true (defaults to false for safety)
   - Calls `Installer::uninstall()` to clean up all plugin data

### Files Modified:

1. **includes/Plugin.php**
   - Updated `activate()` method (line 155) to call `Installer::install()` on plugin activation
   - Updated `init()` method (line 114) to call `Installer::maybe_upgrade()` to check for version upgrades on every load

## How to Verify

Run the verification commands:
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

Both commands complete successfully (no lint/test failures).

To manually verify the database implementation:
1. Activate the plugin in WordPress admin
2. Check database for tables: `wp_wpha_scan_history` and `wp_wpha_scheduled_tasks`
3. Check options table for `wpha_version` option
4. Update plugin version and reload to test upgrade path
5. Define `WPHA_DELETE_PLUGIN_DATA` constant as `true` and uninstall to verify clean removal

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **No automated tests**: The test suite is not yet configured. Consider adding PHPUnit tests for the Installer class
- **Manual testing required**: Database table creation should be manually tested in a WordPress environment
- **Delete safety**: The uninstall process requires manual constant definition, which is safe but may need documentation
- **Upgrade testing**: Version upgrade paths should be tested with different version scenarios
- **Table indexes**: Consider adding composite indexes if query patterns require them in the future
