## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Reviewed and improved `includes/database/Optimizer.php` for safe table optimization operations:

### Issues Found and Fixed:

1. **InnoDB vs MyISAM Handling (Critical Fix)**
   - **Previous**: Used `ANALYZE TABLE` for InnoDB (only updates statistics, doesn't reclaim space)
   - **Fixed**: Now uses `OPTIMIZE TABLE` for all engines, which performs an online table rebuild for InnoDB to reclaim fragmented space
   - Removed the now-unused `get_optimization_command()` method

2. **REPAIR TABLE Engine Compatibility (Critical Fix)**
   - **Previous**: Attempted to repair any table regardless of engine type
   - **Fixed**: Added engine compatibility check - `REPAIR TABLE` is only supported for MyISAM, Aria, ARCHIVE, and CSV engines. InnoDB tables now return an informative error message directing users to use `optimize_table()` instead

3. **Progress Reporting (New Feature)**
   - Added `set_progress_callback()` method allowing callers to track optimization progress
   - The callback receives: current index, total count, and current table name
   - Called before each table is optimized in `optimize_all_tables()`

4. **Large Table Handling (New Feature)**
   - Added `LARGE_TABLE_THRESHOLD` constant (100MB) to identify tables that may cause performance issues during optimization
   - Added `is_large` flag to results from `get_tables_needing_optimization()`, `optimize_table()`, and `optimize_all_tables()`
   - Added `data_size` field to `get_tables_needing_optimization()` results

5. **Documentation Improvements**
   - Added detailed PHPDoc comments about table locking implications
   - Documented that MyISAM gets full locks while InnoDB performs online DDL
   - Added `@since 1.4.0` tags for all new features

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run linting (no errors expected)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all should pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **API Change**: The `optimize_table()` and `optimize_all_tables()` return values now include `is_large` flag and no longer include `command` field. Callers relying on `command` field will need updates.

2. **Behavioral Change**: InnoDB tables now use `OPTIMIZE TABLE` instead of `ANALYZE TABLE`. This performs a full table rebuild which:
   - Actually reclaims disk space (intended behavior)
   - May take longer than before on large InnoDB tables
   - Is an online operation with minimal blocking, but still has performance implications

3. **Consider Future Enhancements**:
   - Add option to skip large tables during batch optimization
   - Add timeout handling for very large tables
   - Add option to run `ANALYZE TABLE` separately for index statistics updates without full rebuild
