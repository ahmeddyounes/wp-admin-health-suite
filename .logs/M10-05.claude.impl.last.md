Perfect! Zero errors, only pre-existing warnings. Now let's create a brief summary document showing what was implemented:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented the ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) integration for the WP Admin Health Suite plugin. The integration follows the established pattern used by Elementor and WooCommerce integrations.

### Files Created:
1. **includes/integrations/class-acf.php** (496 lines)
   - Main ACF integration class with comprehensive media detection capabilities
   - Implements detection for image, gallery, and file ACF field types
   - Handles nested fields in repeaters, flexible content, and group fields
   - Provides recursive data structure search for attachment IDs
   - Prevents false positives through proper validation

### Files Modified:
1. **includes/Plugin.php**
   - Added ACF integration property (`$acf`)
   - Added initialization logic in `load_dependencies()` method
   - Added getter method `get_acf()` for accessing the integration instance

### Key Features Implemented:

✅ **ACF Field Type Detection:**
- Image fields
- Gallery fields  
- File fields
- Nested fields in repeaters
- Flexible content layouts
- Group fields

✅ **Media Reference Detection:**
- Scans ACF field groups for media field keys
- Queries postmeta for ACF image references
- Handles various ACF storage formats (direct IDs, arrays, serialized data, JSON)
- Recursive search through nested data structures
- Integrates with media scanner via `wpha_media_is_attachment_used` filter

✅ **Additional Capabilities:**
- Field statistics and reporting
- Posts using ACF fields tracking
- ACF version detection
- Attachment ID validation to prevent false positives

## How to Verify

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Lint check (should show 0 errors, only warnings)
npm run lint

# Run test suite (all tests should pass)
npm test

# PHP coding standards (should show 0 errors)
vendor/bin/phpcs includes/integrations/class-acf.php --standard=WordPress --report=summary
```

### Manual Testing:
1. Install ACF (Free or Pro) on a WordPress site
2. Create custom fields with image, gallery, or file types
3. Add repeater or flexible content fields with nested image fields
4. Assign the fields to posts and upload images
5. Run the media audit scanner - ACF images should be properly detected as "in use"

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk Items:
- **Direct database calls**: The integration uses direct `$wpdb` queries (similar to Elementor and WooCommerce integrations) which generate coding standard warnings but are necessary for efficient scanning
- **Caching**: Currently no caching implemented for ACF field metadata queries - could be optimized in future if performance issues arise

### Future Enhancements:
1. Add cleanup functionality for orphaned ACF meta (similar to Elementor/WooCommerce integrations)
2. Add performance insights specific to ACF usage
3. Implement caching layer for frequently accessed ACF field metadata
4. Add support for ACF Options pages if image fields are commonly stored there
5. Consider adding ACF-specific database optimization suggestions

### Testing Notes:
- Tested against coding standards: ✅ 0 errors
- Tested against linter: ✅ 0 errors  
- Tested against test suite: ✅ 101/101 tests passing
- Ready for integration testing with actual ACF installations

The implementation is complete and follows all acceptance criteria from the specification:
- ✅ ACF image fields detected
- ✅ Nested field images found (repeater, flexible content)
- ✅ No false positives (through proper attachment validation)
