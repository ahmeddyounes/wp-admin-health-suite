## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created comprehensive developer documentation for hooks and filters at `/docs/developers/hooks.md` including:

1. **Complete Hook & Filter Reference** - Documented all 15 hooks and filters found in the codebase:
   - 2 Filters: `wpha_execute_cleanup`, `wpha_registered_plugin_tables`
   - 13 Actions: Core lifecycle hooks including init, activation, deactivation, upgrade, REST API, scheduler, database, admin, and assets hooks

2. **Organized by Categories**:
   - Scan Hooks (none currently available)
   - Cleanup Hooks (1 filter)
   - UI Hooks (1 filter)
   - Settings Hooks (none currently available)
   - Core & Lifecycle Hooks (13 actions)

3. **Detailed Documentation** for each hook includes:
   - Hook name and type (action/filter)
   - File location with line number
   - Parameters with types and descriptions
   - Return values (for filters)
   - Purpose and usage context
   - Code examples

4. **Common Customization Examples** section with 7 real-world scenarios:
   - Adding custom plugin tables to exclusions
   - Implementing custom cleanup tasks
   - Extending scan locations
   - Modifying cleanup recommendations
   - Custom logging integration
   - Database migration on upgrade
   - Custom REST API endpoints

5. **Best Practices** section covering:
   - Function naming conventions
   - Hook priorities
   - Existence checking
   - Return value handling
   - Error handling
   - Documentation standards

## How to Verify

Run the verification commands:

```bash
# Lint (warnings only, no errors - acceptable)
npm run lint

# Tests (passes with no tests)
npm test
```

View the documentation:
```bash
cat docs/developers/hooks.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

**Risks:**
- None. Documentation-only change with no code modifications.

**Follow-ups:**
- Consider adding actual scan-specific hooks in future versions for more granular control
- Consider adding settings-specific hooks for customizing admin UI and behavior
- May want to add more filter hooks for modifying scan results and recommendations
- Could add PHPDoc blocks to hook invocations in the codebase for better IDE support

**Acceptance Criteria Met:**
✅ Created `/docs/developers/hooks.md`
✅ Listed all actions and filters with name, location, parameters, and example usage
✅ Categorized into: Scan hooks, Cleanup hooks, UI hooks, Settings hooks (plus Core/Lifecycle)
✅ Included code examples for common customizations (7 detailed examples)
✅ Developers can now extend plugin functionality using documented hooks
