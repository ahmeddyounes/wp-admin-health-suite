Excellent! The implementation is complete and successful:

## **Status: ✅ DONE**

Task M09-06 (JavaScript Tests Setup) has been successfully implemented. All 101 tests are passing across 5 test suites with 0 ESLint errors.

## **Summary of Changes**

Successfully implemented comprehensive JavaScript testing infrastructure:

1. **Test Infrastructure**:
   - Updated `jest.setup.js` to import `@testing-library/jest-dom` for enhanced DOM matchers
   - Enhanced `jest.config.js` with coverage reporting (text, lcov, html) and 70% thresholds  
   - Updated `.eslintrc.json` to properly handle test files with jest environment

2. **Component Tests Created** (101 tests total):
   - `HealthScoreCircle.test.jsx` - 13 tests covering rendering, grades, colors, loading states, accessibility
   - `MetricCard.test.jsx` - 20 tests covering display, trends, interactions, accessibility  
   - `Recommendations.test.jsx` - 29 tests covering filtering, sorting, actions, localStorage persistence
   - `ActivityTimeline.test.jsx` - 19 tests covering API fetching, error handling, formatting
   - `QuickActions.test.jsx` - 20 tests covering modals, toasts, confirmations, keyboard accessibility

3. **Mocking Strategy**:
   - WordPress globals (wp.apiFetch, wp.i18n, wpAdminHealthData) mocked in `jest.setup.js`
   - localStorage mocked for Recommendations tests
   - Fetch API mocked for QuickActions tests  
   - Fake timers configured for async operations

## **How to Verify**

```bash
# Run all tests (✅ 101 passing tests)
npm test

# Run linter (✅ 0 errors, 44 warnings)
npm run lint

# Generate coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

## **Risks / Follow-ups**

**Low Risk Items**:
- 44 ESLint warnings remain (mostly react/prop-types warnings) - these are acceptable and don't affect functionality
- Some console.error calls in tests are expected for error state testing - these are normal
- Consider adding PropTypes to components in the future for better type safety

**Recommendations**:
- Coverage thresholds set at 70% - consider increasing as project matures
- Consider adding integration tests in the future for full user workflows
- All acceptance criteria have been met ✅
