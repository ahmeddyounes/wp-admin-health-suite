Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Updated `includes/Integrations/Acf.php` to detect ACF media usage across `image`, `file`, and especially `gallery` fields (serialized arrays + JSON arrays/objects), including nested Repeater/Group/Flexible Content sub-fields by filtering to ACF media fields via the `_field_name` → `field_...` references.
- Cached ACF media field-key discovery to avoid repeatedly parsing field groups.
- Added standalone coverage: enhanced `tests/bootstrap-standalone.php` stubs and added `tests/unit-standalone/Integration/AcfIntegrationTest.php` to verify nested field-key extraction + gallery detection + labeled context.

How to verify:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups:
- `check_acf_image_usage()` intentionally uses broad LIKE patterns (including serialized `i:<id>;`) to avoid false negatives; this can yield false positives for small IDs that appear as serialized array indexes, which is safer for “unused media” deletion but may under-report unused media in edge cases.
