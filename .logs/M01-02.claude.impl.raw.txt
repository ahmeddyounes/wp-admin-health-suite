Let me create a brief summary document of the implementation:\n\n## Status: DONE\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nSuccessfully implemented the HealthScoreCircle React component as specified in M01-02:\n\n1. **Created** `assets/js/components/HealthScoreCircle.jsx` - A fully functional React component that:\n   - Accepts three props: `score` (0-100), `grade` (A-F), and `loading` (boolean)\n   - Renders an animated SVG circular progress indicator\n   - Uses exact color coding from spec:\n     - A: #00a32a (green)\n     - B: #2271b1 (blue)\n     - C: #dba617 (yellow)\n     - D: #d63638 (orange)\n     - F: #b32d2e (red)\n   - Implements smooth count-up animation from 0 to score over 1.5 seconds using `requestAnimationFrame`\n   - Uses easing function (easeOutCubic) for natural-looking animation\n   - Displays grade letter prominently in the center with the animated score below\n   - Includes accessibility features with `aria-label` describing the score and grade\n   - Color-blind friendly design with grade letters always visible alongside colors\n   - Compatible with all modern browsers (uses standard React hooks and SVG)\n\n2. **Component Features**:\n   - Properly handles loading state with \"Loading...\" message\n   - Cleans up animation frame on unmount to prevent memory leaks\n   - Responsive SVG-based design (200x200px)\n   - Smooth stroke-dashoffset transitions for the circular progress\n   - Round line caps for polished appearance\n\n## How to Verify\n\nRun the verification commands:\n```bash\nnpm run lint\nnpm test\n```\n\nBoth commands execute successfully (no linting or tests configured yet, which is expected for this project stage).\n\nTo verify the component works correctly, it would need to be:\n1. Imported into a React application\n2. Rendered with sample props like: `<HealthScoreCircle score={85} grade=\"B\" loading={false} />`\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n1. **Build Setup**: The component is written in JSX but the project doesn't have a build system configured (no webpack, babel, etc.). A build process will need to be added to transpile this React component for use in WordPress.\n\n2. **React Dependencies**: The component requires React and ReactDOM to be available. These dependencies should be:\n   - Added to package.json\n   - Either bundled or loaded via WordPress's script enqueuing system\n\n3. **Integration**: The component needs to be integrated into the WordPress plugin's admin interface, which will require:\n   - Setting up a build process\n   - Enqueuing the compiled script in WordPress\n   - Creating a container element where the React component can mount\n\n4. **Testing**: No automated tests exist yet. Consider adding:\n   - Unit tests for the animation logic\n   - Visual regression tests for the SVG rendering\n   - Accessibility testing with screen readers","session_id":"92f51ae5-878d-4966-b4e4-22252df7d617","total_cost_usd":0.5394439999999999,"usage":{"input_tokens":360,"cache_creation_input_tokens":23038,"cache_read_input_tokens":486035,"output_tokens":3983,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":23038}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":5796,"outputTokens":401,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.007801,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":360,"outputTokens":3983,"cacheReadInputTokens":486035,"cacheCreationInputTokens":23038,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.29302800000000007,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":1043,"outputTokens":9336,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.23861500000000002,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"aed345d6-8e3d-4ff0-84cc-5833a6edf4ea"}
