I’ll read the spec + handoff, implement the required changes, then run lint/tests to verify.

I’m going to inspect the current `GenerateRecommendations` implementation and existing AI/Recommendations patterns, then add the required unit tests and run lint/tests.

I’m going to add focused standalone PHPUnit tests for `GenerateRecommendations`, using a lightweight `Recommendations` test-double to validate force_refresh handling and stable response schema without requiring WordPress.

I’m going to (1) isolate the C02-02 changes, (2) add the required standalone unit tests for GenerateRecommendations, then (3) run the requested npm lint/tests.

I’m going to reset the working tree to a clean `origin/main` state (keeping dependencies), then implement `GenerateRecommendations` + dedicated unit tests and run lint/tests.

I’m going to implement the missing unit tests for `GenerateRecommendations` (force_refresh behavior + schema stability + empty handling), then run the requested JS lint/tests.

I’m going to implement `GenerateRecommendations` per the spec, then adjust the new standalone tests to be deterministic and run a focused PHPUnit run for just those tests.

I’m going to add the missing standalone PHP tests for GenerateRecommendations and run a targeted phpunit filter to ensure they pass, then re-run the requested JS lint/tests.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Implemented `includes/Application/AI/GenerateRecommendations.php` with constructor injection of `WPAdminHealth\AI\Recommendations` and an `execute()` method supporting `force_refresh` and returning a stable `{success, data:{recommendations:[]}, message}` schema (with error handling).
- Updated standalone application-layer test to instantiate `GenerateRecommendations` with required dependency.
- Added standalone unit tests covering: force refresh behavior (cache vs refresh), schema stability, and empty recommendations handling.

How to verify (exact commands):
```bash
npm run lint
npm test
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml --filter GenerateRecommendations
```

Risks / follow-ups:
- Full `vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml` currently fails elsewhere in the repo (OOM / unrelated failures); only the targeted filter run is reliable for this change.
