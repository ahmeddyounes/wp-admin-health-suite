Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Tightened `SchedulableInterface` contract docs (removed outdated frequency note, documented result/schema expectations) and added frequency constants in `includes/Scheduler/Contracts/SchedulableInterface.php:17`.
- Expanded `SchedulerRegistryInterface` to cover the public scheduling/lookup APIs already provided by `SchedulerRegistry` (hook mapping, scheduling/unscheduling, next-run, task definitions) in `includes/Scheduler/Contracts/SchedulerRegistryInterface.php:17`.

How to verify
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups
- Adding methods/constants to `SchedulerRegistryInterface` is a breaking change for any third-party implementations of that interface (none exist in this repo).
- `npm run lint` still reports existing warnings (no errors).
