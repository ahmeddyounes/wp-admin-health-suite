Excellent! All verification steps have passed. Now let me provide the final response to the user:

## Status: DONE ✅

Task M10-01 (Internationalization Setup) has been fully implemented and verified.

## Summary of Changes

### 1. PHP Internationalization
- **Already implemented**: All PHP files already had proper i18n functions (`__()`, `_e()`, `_n()`, `_x()`) with the 'wp-admin-health-suite' text domain
- **Verified**: Main plugin file has `load_plugin_textdomain()` configured to load translations from `/languages/` directory

### 2. JavaScript Internationalization
**Modified `includes/Assets.php`:**
- Added 'wp-i18n' to bundle dependencies (line 206)
- Added `wp_set_script_translations()` for each script bundle (lines 221-226) to enable WordPress translation system for JavaScript
- Updated ellipsis characters in localized strings to use proper character (…)

**Modified `assets/js/admin.js`:**
- Added wp.i18n import with fallback (line 24)
- Wrapped all user-facing strings in `__()` function calls with 'wp-admin-health-suite' text domain
- Updated strings: API errors, modal dialogs, progress tracker, toast notifications
- Changed ellipsis from "..." to "…" for WordPress coding standards

### 3. Translation Files
**Created `/languages/` directory structure:**
- `languages/.gitkeep` - ensures directory is tracked in git
- `languages/wp-admin-health-suite.pot` - translation template with 50+ translatable strings
- `languages/README.md` - documentation for translators with WP-CLI commands

## How to Verify

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Check code quality (passing with warnings only)
npm run lint

# Run all tests (101/101 passing)
npm test
```

Both commands execute successfully:
- **Lint**: Passes with only warnings (no errors)
- **Tests**: All 101 tests pass across 5 test suites

## Acceptance Criteria Met

✅ All user-facing strings wrapped in i18n functions  
✅ Text domain 'wp-admin-health-suite' used consistently  
✅ `/languages/` directory created  
✅ `.pot` file generated with all translatable strings  
✅ JavaScript strings using wp.i18n via `__()` function  
✅ `wp_set_script_translations()` configured in Assets.php  
✅ No hardcoded user-facing text remaining  
✅ All lint checks passing  
✅ All tests passing  

## Risks / Follow-ups

**Low Risk Items:**
1. **WP-CLI not available**: The .pot file was created manually following standard gettext format. To regenerate with official WP-CLI tool in the future, run:
   ```bash
   wp i18n make-pot . languages/wp-admin-health-suite.pot
   ```

2. **Lint warnings**: The codebase has pre-existing ESLint warnings (JSDoc types, prop-types). These are warnings only, not errors, and don't affect functionality.

**No Breaking Changes:**
- All existing functionality preserved
- Translation system is opt-in (works without translations)
- No changes to user experience until translations are added

**Next Steps (Optional):**
1. Create translation files for target languages (.po/.mo files)
2. Add translator comments for context-sensitive strings
3. Consider adding PropTypes validation to React components to reduce lint warnings
