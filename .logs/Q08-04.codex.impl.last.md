Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Updated `includes/Scheduler/Traits/HasScheduledTasks.php` to be safer/more reusable: adds `@phpstan-require-extends ServiceProvider`, supports an optional task-list override, validates the registry type, sanitizes/dedupes task lists, and improves WP_DEBUG logging for misconfigurations.
- Refactored `includes/Providers/SchedulerServiceProvider.php` to use `HasScheduledTasks` via `get_scheduled_tasks()` and to delegate registration to the trait while keeping the `wpha_scheduler_tasks_registered` action.

How to verify
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups
- `register_scheduled_tasks()` now ignores non-string task references (expected to be task class/service IDs); callers should pass class-strings as documented.
