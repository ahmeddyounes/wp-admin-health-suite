Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Tightened Custom Admin CSS sanitization used for `custom_css` saves/imports (`includes/Settings/SettingsRegistry.php:327`).
- Hardened settings import by actually enforcing `wp_check_filetype_and_ext()` (with fallbacks for common JSON MIME variations) and added a guard for failed JSON export encoding (`includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:488`, `includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:553`).
- Clarified the Advanced settings section description to reflect REST API/rate limiting/CSS/tools scope (`includes/Settings/Domain/AdvancedSettings.php:36`).

How to verify:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups:
- Import is now stricter about MIME detection; very unusual server MIME reporting could block otherwise-valid JSON uploads.
- `npm run lint` currently reports warnings (but exits successfully).
