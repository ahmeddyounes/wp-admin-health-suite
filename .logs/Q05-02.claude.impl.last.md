## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I reviewed and improved `includes/AI/OneClickFix.php` with the following changes:

### 1. **Added Confirmation Requirements** (lines 250-258, 309-317)
- `execute_fix()` now requires explicit `$confirm = true` parameter
- `execute_all_safe()` now requires explicit `$confirm = true` parameter
- Returns `requires_confirm => true` response if confirmation not provided
- This prevents accidental execution of destructive operations

### 2. **Improved Preview Validation** (lines 206-220)
- `get_fix_preview()` now validates that the fix ID exists in available safe fixes before returning preview data
- Prevents previews for non-existent or disabled fixes

### 3. **Enhanced Rollback Mechanism** (lines 715-812)
- Updated `store_rollback_info()` with better documentation explaining that most operations are permanent
- Added `user_id` tracking for audit purposes
- Added new `get_rollback_info()` public method to retrieve rollback data
- Added new `is_fix_reversible()` method to identify which fixes can be reversed (only table optimization is reversible)
- Added new `get_recent_fix_history()` method for audit trail access
- All preview data now includes a `reversible` flag so users know which operations are permanent

### 4. **Removed Unused Variable** (line 156)
- Removed unused `$revisions_count` variable that was assigned but never used

### 5. **Improved Batch Execution Error Handling** (line 346)
- Added explicit type checking for result array in `execute_all_safe()` to handle edge cases

### 6. **Fixed PHPStan Issue** (line 777)
- Changed `is_fix_reversible()` implementation from associative array to simple array with `in_array()` to avoid static analysis warning

### 7. **Fixed DocBlock Formatting** (line 110)
- Fixed improperly indented `@since` tag in `get_safe_fixes()` docblock

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run linter (should show 0 errors, only pre-existing warnings)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 101 tests should pass)
npm test

# Run PHPStan on the changed file
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse includes/AI/OneClickFix.php --level=5 --memory-limit=512M
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Breaking change for API consumers**: The `execute_fix()` and `execute_all_safe()` methods now require a `$confirm` parameter. Any existing code calling these methods without the parameter will receive a `requires_confirm` response instead of executing. This is intentional for safety but may require updates to REST endpoints or frontend code that calls these methods.

2. **No actual rollback capability**: The rollback mechanism stores metadata for audit purposes only. Most database cleanup operations (deleting spam comments, revisions, transients) are permanent and cannot be rolled back. Only table optimization is marked as reversible. Users should be aware that deleted data cannot be recovered without a database backup.

3. **Consider adding REST endpoint**: The `OneClickFix` class is registered in the container but not yet exposed via REST API. A future task should add a REST controller with proper nonce verification and capability checks to expose these methods to the frontend.
