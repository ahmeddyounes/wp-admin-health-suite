**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Modified `includes/Assets.php` (line 195):
- Added `wp-api-fetch` to the baseline JavaScript dependencies array for all page-specific bundles
- Changed from: `array( 'react', 'react-dom', 'wp-i18n' )`
- Changed to: `array( 'react', 'react-dom', 'wp-i18n', 'wp-api-fetch' )`

### Why This Change Was Needed

The JavaScript code throughout the plugin uses `wp.apiFetch` (found in 10 files including `api.js`, `admin.js`, various component files). However:
1. The webpack-generated `assets/js/dist/assets.php` only listed `react`, `react-dom`, and `wp-polyfill` as dependencies
2. The `enqueue_admin_scripts()` method only added `react`, `react-dom`, and `wp-i18n` as baseline dependencies

This could cause `wp.apiFetch is undefined` errors on admin pages because WordPress wouldn't know to load the `wp-api-fetch` script before our bundles.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (no errors expected)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 tests should pass)
npm test
```

Additionally, you can verify in a WordPress environment:
1. Load any plugin admin page (dashboard, database-health, media-audit, performance, or settings)
2. Open browser dev tools console
3. Confirm no "wp.apiFetch is undefined" or missing script errors
4. Test API-dependent functionality like refreshing recommendations or fetching activity timeline

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: This is a safe, additive change that ensures a required dependency is always loaded
- **No breaking changes**: Adding the dependency doesn't affect functionality if it was already loaded by other means
- **Future improvement**: Consider updating the webpack configuration to properly externalize `wp-api-fetch` so it's automatically detected in `assets.php` (but this is not strictly necessary since the baseline dependency approach works reliably)
