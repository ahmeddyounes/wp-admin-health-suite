## Summary of changes

### Review Findings for `includes/media/SafeDelete.php`

The SafeDelete class implements a robust two-step media deletion mechanism with the following key features:

1. **Two-Step Deletion Mechanism**: 
   - `prepare_deletion()` moves files to a trash directory and stores metadata in database
   - `execute_deletion()` performs permanent deletion of files from trash
   - `restore_deleted()` recovers files from trash back to original locations

2. **30-Day Recovery Window**:
   - `$retention_days = 30` configures the retention period
   - `get_deletion_queue()` calculates `days_remaining` and `can_restore` based on deletion date
   - `auto_purge_expired()` removes items older than retention period

3. **Proper File System Cleanup**:
   - Uses `safe_unlink()` with TOCTOU protection
   - Validates paths stay within allowed directories
   - Refuses to delete symlinks (prevents symlink attacks)
   - Properly handles non-existent files

4. **Thumbnail Handling**:
   - `move_thumbnails_to_trash()` moves all size variants to trash
   - Stores mapping of trash paths to original paths in metadata
   - `restore_deleted()` restores all thumbnails along with main file

5. **Security Measures**:
   - `normalize_path()` prevents path traversal attacks (null bytes, `..` sequences)
   - `is_path_within()` validates paths are within allowed directories
   - `safe_rename()` and `safe_unlink()` perform final validation before operations
   - `basename()` used on metadata filenames to prevent injection

### Files Changed

1. **Created**: `tests/unit-standalone/Media/SafeDeleteTest.php`
   - 27 comprehensive tests covering all key functionality
   - Tests for path normalization and security validations
   - Tests for symlink rejection (TOCTOU protection)
   - Tests for recovery window calculations
   - Tests for file operations

2. **Modified**: `tests/bootstrap-standalone.php`
   - Added `ARRAY_A`, `ARRAY_N`, `OBJECT`, `OBJECT_K` constants for wpdb output types
   - Added `DAY_IN_SECONDS`, `HOUR_IN_SECONDS`, `MINUTE_IN_SECONDS` constants
   - Added `WP_CONTENT_DIR` constant
   - Added WordPress function stubs: `wp_upload_dir()`, `get_post()`, `get_attached_file()`, `wp_get_attachment_metadata()`, `get_post_meta()`, `update_post_meta()`, `wp_mkdir_p()`, `wp_delete_attachment()`, `wp_insert_post()`, `update_attached_file()`, `wp_update_attachment_metadata()`, `current_time()`, `sanitize_file_name()`, `wp_rand()`

## How to verify

```bash
# Run the new SafeDelete tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml --filter SafeDeleteTest

# Run all standalone tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run Jest tests
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **WordPress Integration Testing**: The standalone tests verify the class logic, but integration tests with actual WordPress would ensure the functions like `get_post()`, `wp_upload_dir()`, etc. behave as expected in production.

2. **Concurrent Access**: While TOCTOU protection is implemented, high-concurrency scenarios might benefit from file locking mechanisms.

3. **Large File Handling**: For very large media files, the synchronous `rename()` operation could block - async processing might be considered for production workloads.

4. **Database Cleanup**: The `auto_purge_expired()` method should be scheduled via WP-Cron to automatically clean up expired items.
