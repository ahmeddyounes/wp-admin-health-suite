## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Consolidated REST route registration by removing three monolithic controllers that were fully replaced by specialized controllers:

1. **Deleted monolithic controller files:**
   - `includes/REST/DatabaseController.php` - replaced by `Database/TableAnalysisController.php`, `Database/CleanupController.php`, `Database/OptimizationController.php`
   - `includes/REST/MediaController.php` - replaced by `Media/MediaScanController.php`, `Media/MediaAnalysisController.php`, `Media/MediaAltTextController.php`, `Media/MediaCleanupController.php`
   - `includes/REST/PerformanceController.php` - replaced by `Performance/PerformanceStatsController.php`, `Performance/QueryAnalysisController.php`, `Performance/PluginProfilerController.php`, `Performance/CacheController.php`, `Performance/AutoloadController.php`, `Performance/HeartbeatController.php`

2. **Updated `includes/Providers/RESTServiceProvider.php`:**
   - Removed imports for `DatabaseController`, `MediaController`, `PerformanceController`
   - Removed class-string identifiers and aliases from `$provides` array
   - Removed container bindings for the three monolithic controllers
   - Updated `register_routes()` to only register specialized controllers (organized with comments for clarity)

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (passes with warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **API backward compatibility**: If external code was directly referencing `rest.database_controller`, `rest.media_controller`, or `rest.performance_controller` service aliases, it will now fail. However, the REST API endpoints themselves remain unchanged since the specialized controllers handle the same routes.

2. **No route changes**: All existing API routes are preserved since the specialized controllers already register identical routes. This is a pure dead code removal with no functional changes to the API surface.
