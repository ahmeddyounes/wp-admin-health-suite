**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

1. **`wp-admin-health-suite.php`** (lines 91-99): Updated the autoload logic to prefer Composer's `vendor/autoload.php` when available, with fallback to the built-in `includes/autoload.php` when the vendor directory is absent. This aligns runtime autoload behavior with CI environments that use `composer install`.

2. **`docs/getting-started.md`**: Added "Method 4: Developer Installation (Composer)" section explaining how to clone and install with Composer, and documenting the autoload behavior.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint (no errors, only pre-existing warnings)
npm run lint

# Tests (all 417 pass)
npm test

# Manual verification:
# 1. With vendor/ directory present (after composer install):
#    - Plugin loads via vendor/autoload.php
# 2. Without vendor/ directory (production distribution):
#    - Plugin falls back to includes/autoload.php
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: The change is additive and preserves backward compatibility. The plugin still works without `vendor/` present.
- **Follow-up consideration**: Ensure `.gitignore` excludes `vendor/` if the repository is meant for distribution without dependencies.
