**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created `assets/js/entries/settings.test.js` - a comprehensive test file for the settings entry point with 16 tests covering:

1. **WPAdminHealthComponents global** (3 tests)
   - Exposes components on window.WPAdminHealthComponents
   - Exposes React
   - Exposes createRoot

2. **Global namespace preservation** (3 tests)
   - Preserves existing WPAdminHealthComponents properties
   - Does not remove previously set components
   - Initializes WPAdminHealthComponents if not already present

3. **React and createRoot availability for settings page** (2 tests)
   - React is available for settings form components
   - createRoot is available for mounting settings UI components

4. **Settings-specific functionality** (5 tests)
   - React hooks for form state management (useState)
   - React hooks for side effects (useEffect)
   - React hooks for refs (useRef)
   - React callback memoization (useCallback)
   - React memo for component optimization

5. **WordPress template integration** (3 tests)
   - WPAdminHealthComponents is accessible globally for WordPress PHP templates
   - Allows creating React elements from WordPress templates
   - Provides Fragment for grouping elements without extra DOM nodes

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint
npm run lint

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only settings tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="settings.test.js" --verbose
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- The settings.js entry point is minimal (only exposes React and createRoot) compared to other entry points that also expose specific components. If settings-specific React components are added in the future, the test file should be updated to cover those components as well.
- All 260 tests pass including the new 16 settings tests.
- Lint passes with 0 errors (159 warnings are pre-existing and unrelated to this change).
