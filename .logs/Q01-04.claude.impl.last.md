The implementation is complete. Let me provide the final summary.

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

### 1. PSR-4 Directory Naming Fixes
Renamed 9 directories from lowercase to PascalCase to match their PHP namespace declarations:

**Top-level directories:**
- `includes/ai` → `includes/AI`
- `includes/database` → `includes/Database`
- `includes/integrations` → `includes/Integrations`
- `includes/media` → `includes/Media`
- `includes/performance` → `includes/Performance`
- `includes/rest` → `includes/REST`

**Nested directories:**
- `includes/REST/database` → `includes/REST/Database`
- `includes/REST/media` → `includes/REST/Media`
- `includes/REST/performance` → `includes/REST/Performance`

This ensures PSR-4 compliance where namespace segments map directly to directory names (case-sensitive), which is critical for case-sensitive file systems like Linux.

### 2. Autoloader Improvements (`includes/autoload.php`)
- Added comprehensive documentation explaining the PSR-4 namespace mapping
- Added `@since` version annotations
- Added error logging for missing class files in development mode (when `WP_DEBUG` and `WP_DEBUG_LOG` are enabled)
- Added explicit `return` values (`true`/`false`) for better autoloader chaining
- Added inline comments explaining PSR-4 case-sensitivity requirements

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run linting (should show 0 errors, only warnings)
npm run lint

# Run tests (should show all tests passing)
npm test

# Verify directory structure is PSR-4 compliant
find includes -type d | sort

# All directory names should be PascalCase (matching namespaces)
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Case-sensitive deployment environments**: The directory renames ensure the autoloader works correctly on case-sensitive file systems (Linux). Previously, loading classes like `WPAdminHealth\Database\Analyzer` would fail on Linux because the directory was `database` (lowercase) but the namespace expected `Database` (PascalCase).

2. **No code changes required**: All PHP files already had correct namespace declarations - only the directory names were incorrect.

3. **Git will track the renames correctly**: The changes are staged as renames, preserving git history.
