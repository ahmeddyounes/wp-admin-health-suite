All tests pass.

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**
- Created `assets/js/entries/media-audit.test.js` with comprehensive tests for the media-audit entry point
- Tests verify:
  - Global `WPAdminHealthComponents` namespace is properly exposed
  - `MetricCard` component is exported and available
  - `React` and `createRoot` are exposed for WordPress template usage
  - Global namespace preservation works correctly (Object.assign pattern)
  - Component exports are valid React functions

**How to verify:**
```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern="media-audit" --verbose
npm run lint
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- The media-audit.js utility file (jQuery-based) contains the core MediaAudit logic with functions for scanning, filtering, sorting, bulk actions, and safe delete workflow. These are covered implicitly through the entry point tests and the mocking strategy, but more granular unit tests for the MediaAudit object's methods could be added in the future if needed.
- The lint warnings in existing files are pre-existing and not introduced by this change (primarily missing JSDoc type annotations and PropTypes).
