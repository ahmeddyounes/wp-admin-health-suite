**Status**
- DONE

**Summary of Changes**
- Hardened settings reads/writes: per-tab saves now preserve non-submitted fields, values are sanitized/validated per field, and settings are cached + filtered to known keys (`includes/Settings/SettingsRegistry.php:91`, `includes/Settings/SettingsRegistry.php:247`).
- Added a settings option JSON schema generator for WordPress Settings/REST usage (`includes/Settings/SettingsRegistry.php:288`) and wired it into `register_setting()` (`includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:190`).
- Ensured checkboxes always submit a value (hidden `0` + checkbox `1`) so “unchecked” persists correctly (`includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:190`).
- Added/ensured a backward-compatible `WPAdminHealth\Settings` facade used by the settings template (`includes/Settings.php:27`).

**How to Verify**
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

**Risks / Follow-ups**
- `show_in_rest` now exposes the option schema via WP’s settings REST endpoint for users with appropriate capability; confirm this is desired for your security posture (`includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:190`).
- Unknown/stale keys in the stored option are filtered out on read/sanitize; if you intentionally stored extra keys in `wpha_settings`, they will no longer round-trip (`includes/Settings/SettingsRegistry.php:91`).
