**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**

1. **composer.json** - Added `"check"` script that runs `@lint:php`, `@analyse`, and `@test:standalone` sequentially (line 63-67)

2. **package.json** - Added `"check"` script that runs `npm run lint && npm run test` (line 15)

3. **README.md** - Added new "Running All Checks (Recommended for Contributors)" section before the existing "Running Tests" section, documenting both `composer check` and `npm run check` commands (lines 220-233)

4. **BUILD.md** - Updated to include:
   - Added `npm run check` to the Build Commands section (line 31-32)
   - Added new "Contributing" section at the end with check command documentation (lines 170-190)

**How to verify:**

```bash
# Test the npm check command
npm run check

# Test the composer check command (runs lint + phpstan + tests)
composer check

# Or run everything
composer check && npm run check
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**

- The `composer check` command will fail if there are pre-existing PHPCS errors in the codebase (there are some currently in `includes/Performance/AjaxMonitor.php` and `wp-admin-health-suite.php`). These are pre-existing issues not introduced by this task.
- The lint step has 158 warnings (0 errors), which is expected based on the existing codebase state.
- All 451 JavaScript tests pass.
