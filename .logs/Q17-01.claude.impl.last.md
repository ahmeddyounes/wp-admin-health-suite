**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive webpack configuration review document at `docs/webpack-configuration-review.md` covering:

1. **Entry Points Configuration** - 5 page-specific bundles properly configured for each admin page
2. **Output Configuration** - Clean builds with predictable naming
3. **Code Splitting** - Identified that vendor chunk is ineffective (React externalized), recommended adding `common` cacheGroup for shared modules
4. **Asset Optimization** - TerserPlugin properly configured, CSS extraction ready but unused
5. **WordPress Dependency Externalization** - Using official `@wordpress/dependency-extraction-webpack-plugin` with `combineAssets: true`
6. **Production Build Settings** - Appropriate mode-aware configuration for dev/prod
7. **Development Server** - HMR and WordPress proxy configured
8. **Module Resolution** - JSX support enabled

**Key Findings:**
- Overall configuration is **Good** with proper WordPress integration
- Code splitting is configured but ineffective (only ~2.6KB from node_modules after externalization)
- Shared modules like `admin.js` (~40KB) are duplicated across bundles
- CSS files exist but are not bundled through webpack (loaded separately via PHP)
- `wp.apiFetch` and `wp.i18n` used dynamically rather than imported, missing from dependency tracking

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (161 warnings, 0 errors - pre-existing)
npm run lint

# Run tests (417 tests pass)
npm test

# Build production
npm run build
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Medium Priority**: Consider importing WordPress packages (`@wordpress/api-fetch`, `@wordpress/i18n`) for proper dependency tracking
2. **Medium Priority**: Add `common` cacheGroup to extract shared modules and reduce bundle duplication
3. **Low Priority**: Add Babel `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` for smaller bundles (package already installed)
4. **Info**: CSS bundling through webpack is configured but not used - current PHP enqueue approach is valid
