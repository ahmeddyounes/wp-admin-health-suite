Perfect! All required methods are implemented. Let me create a quick summary of what was implemented:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

I have successfully implemented the Plugin Performance Profiler feature as specified in M04-01. The implementation includes:

### Created files:
1. **includes/performance/class-plugin-profiler.php** - Main profiler class with all required methods
2. **includes/performance/index.php** - Security index file

### Implemented methods:
1. **measure_plugin_impact()** - Measures plugin impact on performance by analyzing:
   - Database query counts (estimated from plugin options)
   - Memory usage (estimated from plugin file sizes)
   - Load time impact
   - Enqueued assets (scripts and styles)
   - Stores results in transient cache (24-hour expiration)
   - Returns ranked list with impact scores

2. **get_slowest_plugins($limit)** - Returns top N plugins by impact score (default: 10)

3. **get_plugin_memory_usage()** - Returns plugins sorted by estimated memory usage

4. **get_plugin_query_counts()** - Returns plugins sorted by estimated database query count

5. **get_asset_counts_by_plugin()** - Returns plugins sorted by total enqueued assets (scripts + styles)

6. **clear_cache()** - Clears the transient cache for fresh measurements

### Key features:
- Uses WordPress transients for 24-hour caching to avoid performance overhead
- Calculates weighted impact scores considering queries, memory, time, and assets
- Clearly documented as providing **approximate estimates** (not exact profiling)
- Follows WordPress coding standards and namespace conventions (WPAdminHealth\Performance)
- Includes comprehensive PHPDoc comments
- Sorts results by relevance (highest impact first)
- Handles edge cases (no active plugins, single-file vs directory plugins)

## How to verify

Run the verification commands:
```bash
npm run lint  # Passes (no linting configured yet)
npm test      # Passes (no tests configured yet)
```

To test the functionality in WordPress:
```php
// Example usage
$profiler = new \WPAdminHealth\Performance\Plugin_Profiler();
$results = $profiler->measure_plugin_impact();
$slowest = $profiler->get_slowest_plugins(5);
$memory = $profiler->get_plugin_memory_usage();
```

## Risks / follow-ups

1. **Approximation nature**: The profiler provides estimates rather than exact measurements since we cannot safely disable/enable plugins at runtime. This is clearly documented in the code and return values.

2. **Performance overhead**: The initial measurement run may cause a brief performance impact. Mitigated by 24-hour transient caching.

3. **Estimation accuracy**: The heuristics used (counting options, file sizes, asset detection) are reasonable but not perfect. They provide useful directional guidance for identifying problematic plugins.

4. **Future enhancements** could include:
   - Integration with WordPress admin UI to display results
   - REST API endpoint for accessing profiler data
   - More sophisticated query counting (hooking into wpdb)
   - Plugin-specific custom table detection
   - Comparison reports over time

The implementation fully meets the acceptance criteria: provides reasonable estimates of plugin impact, clearly communicates the approximate nature, and helps identify problem plugins.
