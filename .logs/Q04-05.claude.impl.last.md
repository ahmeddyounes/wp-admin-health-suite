The implementation is complete. Let me provide the final summary.

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Enhanced `includes/Performance/CacheChecker.php` with comprehensive cache detection capabilities:

### 1. Object Cache Detection Improvements (`detect_cache_backend()` - lines 266-324)
- Added checks for Redis by object properties (`redis`, `redis_client`)
- Added checks for WP_REDIS_VERSION and WP_REDIS_CLIENT constants
- Added checks for Memcached by object properties (`mc`, `memcache`)
- Added APCu detection via object-cache.php drop-in file content analysis
- Improved fallback logic for file-based cache detection

### 2. Page Cache Detection (new method `detect_page_cache()` - lines 622-657)
- Checks for `WP_CACHE` constant
- Checks for `advanced-cache.php` drop-in
- Detects popular page cache plugins
- Detects server-level caching (Varnish, nginx FastCGI, LiteSpeed, Cloudflare, Sucuri)

### 3. Browser Cache Detection (new method `detect_browser_cache_config()` - lines 801-881)
- Checks `.htaccess` for mod_expires and Cache-Control rules (Apache)
- Checks `web.config` for clientCache and custom headers (IIS)
- Detects if caching plugins are managing browser cache

### 4. Popular Caching Plugin Detection (new methods - lines 666-740, 890-908)
- Detects 15+ popular caching plugins:
  - WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, WP Rocket, LiteSpeed Cache
  - WP Fastest Cache, Cache Enabler, Autoptimize, Breeze
  - Hummingbird, Swift Performance, Comet Cache, SG Optimizer
  - Powered Cache, NitroPack, Redis Object Cache, Object Cache Pro

### 5. Server-Level Cache Detection (new method `detect_server_level_cache()` - lines 749-790)
- Varnish (via HTTP_X_VARNISH and HTTP_VIA headers)
- nginx FastCGI cache
- LiteSpeed server
- Cloudflare CDN
- Sucuri firewall/CDN

### 6. Updated `get_cache_status()` (lines 70-86)
- Added new keys: `object_cache`, `page_cache`, `browser_cache`, `caching_plugins`
- These fields are now available for the AI Recommendations engine

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run linter (should have 0 errors, only warnings)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 101 tests should pass)
npm test

# Run PHPStan on the modified file
./vendor/bin/phpstan analyse includes/Performance/CacheChecker.php --level=5 --memory-limit=512M
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **File reading for APCu detection** - The APCu fallback detection reads `object-cache.php` content. This is safe but adds minor I/O overhead. Consider caching this result if called frequently.

2. **Server variable availability** - Server-level cache detection relies on HTTP headers that may not always be present (e.g., in CLI context). The code handles this gracefully by returning `null`.

3. **Plugin detection maintenance** - The list of detectable plugins may need updates as new popular caching plugins emerge or existing ones rename their classes/constants.

4. **File naming convention** - PHPCS reports file naming warnings (expected `class-cachechecker.php` but found `CacheChecker.php`). This is consistent with the project's existing convention and not changed.
