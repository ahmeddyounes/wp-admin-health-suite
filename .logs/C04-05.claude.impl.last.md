## Status: Complete

**Summary:**
Task C04-05 is complete. Safe mode is now consistently enforced across all task execution paths:

1. **REST controllers** (already implemented) - Check `is_safe_mode_enabled()` before executing destructive operations and return preview data when enabled

2. **Scheduled tasks (cron)** - `DatabaseCleanupTask` now receives `SettingsInterface` via dependency injection and checks safe mode at the start of `execute()`, returning preview data instead of performing deletions

3. **Tests created** - `tests/unit-standalone/Database/Tasks/DatabaseCleanupTaskSafeModeTest.php` with 16 tests that verify:
   - Safe mode prevents revisions cleanup
   - Safe mode prevents transients cleanup  
   - Safe mode prevents orphaned data cleanup
   - Safe mode prevents spam deletion
   - Safe mode prevents trash cleanup
   - Safe mode override via options
   - Normal mode executes cleanup correctly

**How to verify:**
```bash
npm run lint              # Passes (warnings only)
npm test                  # 417 tests pass
composer test:standalone -- --filter DatabaseCleanupTaskSafeModeTest  # 16 tests pass
```

**Risks/follow-ups:**
- 8 pre-existing test errors in `ApplicationLayerTest.php` (missing constructor arguments) and `ExceptionsTest.php` (missing WordPress functions) are unrelated to this task and existed prior to these changes
