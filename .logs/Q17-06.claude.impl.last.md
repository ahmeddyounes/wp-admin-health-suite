**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive Composer Configuration Review document at `docs/composer-configuration-review.md` that analyzes:

1. **Package Metadata** - Validated name, description, type, license; noted version field warning
2. **Dependency Management** - Reviewed production and dev dependencies, all up-to-date
3. **Autoload Configuration** - Identified case mismatch issues in classmap (6 directories have incorrect casing)
4. **Custom Autoloader** - Analyzed `includes/autoload.php` PSR-4 implementation
5. **Development Autoloading** - Verified test directories match configuration
6. **Configuration Options** - Confirmed best practices (optimize-autoloader, sort-packages, allow-plugins)
7. **Script Definitions** - Found `test:all` incomplete (only runs standalone tests) and duplicate scripts
8. **Stability Settings** - Verified appropriate for production

**Key Findings:**
- Classmap has case mismatches (`database/` vs `Database/`) - should be removed since PSR-4 handles it
- `test:all` script only runs `@test:standalone`, missing `@test`
- Duplicate scripts: `phpcs`/`lint:php` and `phpcbf`/`lint:php:fix`
- Overall score: 8.5/10

## How to Verify

```bash
# View the review document
cat docs/composer-configuration-review.md

# Verify linting passes (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Verify tests pass
npm test

# Validate composer.json
composer validate
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Low Risk:** The classmap case mismatches in `composer.json` are redundant with PSR-4 and could cause issues on case-sensitive systems. The autoloader still works because PSR-4 takes precedence.

2. **Action Item:** The `test:all` script should be fixed to include `@test` in addition to `@test:standalone`.

3. **Future Consideration:** PHP 7.4 is end-of-life; consider upgrading minimum PHP requirement to 8.0+.
