Perfect! Let me create a summary of what was changed:

## Summary of Changes

I successfully fixed the React components build system to pass all verification commands. Here's what was changed:

### Fixed ESLint Errors (2 → 0 errors)

1. **`assets/js/components/ActivityTimeline.jsx:314`** - Fixed unescaped apostrophe in JSX
   - Changed `site's` to `site&apos;s` to properly escape the apostrophe character

2. **`assets/js/components/QuickActions.jsx:383`** - Fixed React Hooks violation
   - Removed `useState` hook that was being called inside the `.map()` callback (violates Rules of Hooks)
   - Replaced React-based hover state with CSS-based hover effects using `:hover` pseudo-class
   - Removed unused `buttonHoverStyles` variable
   - Updated styleSheet to include `.quick-action-button:hover` CSS rule

### Verification Results

✅ **Linting**: `npm run lint`
- **Before**: 44 problems (2 errors, 42 warnings)
- **After**: 42 problems (0 errors, 42 warnings)
- All errors eliminated - only warnings remain (PropTypes validation)

✅ **Tests**: `npm test`
- Passes with `--passWithNoTests` flag

✅ **Build**: `npm run build`
- Successfully compiles all bundles
- Production bundles are minified and optimized
- Output: dashboard (65KB), performance (56KB), database-health (37KB), media-audit (33KB), settings (12KB)

### Files Modified
- `assets/js/components/ActivityTimeline.jsx` - Fixed apostrophe escape
- `assets/js/components/QuickActions.jsx` - Fixed React Hooks violation and removed unused code
- All changes maintain functionality while ensuring code quality

The build system is now fully functional with zero ESLint errors!
