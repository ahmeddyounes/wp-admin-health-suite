Let me provide a final summary:\n\n---\n\n## Status: DONE ✅\n\n## Summary of Changes\n\nI have successfully implemented M08-08 (Changelog & Versioning) by creating comprehensive documentation following industry best practices.\n\n### Files Created:\n\n1. **CHANGELOG.md** (180 lines)\n   - Follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format\n   - Adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)\n   - Includes all required sections: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security\n   - Comprehensive documentation of all features implemented from M00-01 through M08-07\n   - Organized into logical categories: Core Infrastructure, Dashboard, Database Health, Media Audit, Performance Monitoring, AI-Powered Recommendations, Settings & Configuration, Internationalization & Security, Admin UI/UX, Developer Features, and Documentation\n   - Version history back to 1.0.0 with release date (2026-01-07)\n   - Includes release notes, minimum requirements, known issues, and future roadmap\n   - Properly formatted version reference links at bottom\n\n2. **readme.txt** (237 lines)\n   - WordPress.org plugin repository format\n   - Complete metadata headers (tags, version, PHP/WP requirements, license)\n   - Comprehensive feature descriptions with emoji icons for better readability\n   - Installation instructions (automatic and manual)\n   - FAQ section answering common user questions\n   - Screenshots section (placeholders for 6 key screens)\n   - Changelog matching CHANGELOG.md\n   - Upgrade notices\n   - Privacy policy section\n   - Support links and credits\n   - Future roadmap\n\n### Version Consistency Verified:\n\nAll version numbers are consistent at **1.0.0** across:\n- ✅ wp-admin-health-suite.php (Plugin header and WP_ADMIN_HEALTH_VERSION constant)\n- ✅ package.json\n- ✅ readme.txt (Stable tag)\n- ✅ CHANGELOG.md\n- ✅ 322+ @since 1.0.0 PHPDoc tags throughout codebase\n\n## How to Verify\n\nRun the verification commands:\n\n```bash\n# Lint check (passes with warnings only, no errors)\nnpm run lint\n\n# Tests (passes - no tests configured)\nnpm test\n\n# Verify version consistency\ngrep -E \"(Version:|\\\"version\\\":|WP_ADMIN_HEALTH_VERSION|Stable tag:)\" wp-admin-health-suite.php package.json readme.txt CHANGELOG.md\n\n# Check changelog format\nhead -50 CHANGELOG.md\n\n# Check readme.txt format\nhead -50 readme.txt\n```\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n### Low Risk:\n- The CHANGELOG.md and readme.txt use placeholder GitHub URLs (`https://github.com/yourusername/wp-admin-health-suite`). These should be updated when the actual repository is created.\n- The \"Contributors\" field in readme.txt uses `yourname` as a placeholder and should be updated with actual WordPress.org username(s) before submission.\n- The \"Tested up to\" field shows 6.4 and should be updated to match the current WordPress version when ready for release.\n\n### Follow-ups:\n1. Update GitHub repository URLs in both files when repository is created\n2. Update contributor username in readme.txt before WordPress.org submission\n3. Add actual screenshots to match the 6 screenshot descriptions in readme.txt\n4. Update \"Tested up to\" version to latest WordPress before release\n5. Consider generating a visual changelog or release notes for marketing purposes\n6. Create git release tag v1.0.0 when ready to publish\n\n### Documentation Quality:\n- Both files provide comprehensive, professional documentation\n- CHANGELOG.md clearly communicates all changes from the initial release\n- readme.txt follows WordPress.org guidelines and best practices\n- Version numbering follows semantic versioning consistently\n- All acceptance criteria from the spec have been met","session_id":"4ab2d871-c96f-4ec9-89f4-5e46af347a06","total_cost_usd":0.7619342500000004,"usage":{"input_tokens":369,"cache_creation_input_tokens":43333,"cache_read_input_tokens":1393075,"output_tokens":8935,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":43333}},"modelUsage":{"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":31226,"outputTokens":1318,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.03781599999999998,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":1043,"outputTokens":134,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.008565000000000001,"contextWindow":200000},"claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929":{"inputTokens":369,"outputTokens":8935,"cacheReadInputTokens":1393075,"cacheCreationInputTokens":43333,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.7155532500000001,"contextWindow":200000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"64ec787a-0b07-4ba6-a404-f23c3d359a30"}
