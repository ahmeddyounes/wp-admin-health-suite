## Summary of Changes

### `includes/media/Scanner.php`

Reviewed and optimized the Media Scanner for efficient media library scanning with proper detection of unused/duplicate/large files, batch processing with generators, and memory management for large libraries.

**Key improvements made:**

1. **Generator-based batch processing** (`get_attachment_ids_generator()`)
   - New private generator method that yields attachment IDs one at a time
   - Uses database-level pagination with `ORDER BY ID ASC` for consistent results
   - Supports optional MIME type filtering (e.g., `image/%` for images only)
   - Checks memory before each batch and stops gracefully if memory is low

2. **Memory limit awareness**
   - Added `is_memory_low()` method that checks against 80% threshold
   - Added `get_memory_limit_bytes()` to parse PHP memory_limit ini setting
   - Added `clear_caches()` to free memory when needed
   - All scanning methods now include memory checks and `memory_limited` flags

3. **Cached media count**
   - Added `$cached_media_count` property to avoid repeated COUNT queries
   - Reduces N+1 query overhead in methods that need the total count

4. **Optimized progress updates**
   - Added `update_progress()` method with configurable interval (default: every 100 items)
   - Reduces transient database writes during long scans

5. **Two-pass duplicate detection** (`find_duplicate_files()`)
   - First pass: Groups files by size (fast, no I/O)
   - Second pass: Only hashes files with matching sizes
   - Significantly reduces I/O for large libraries where most files have unique sizes

6. **Single-pass full scan** (`scan_all_media()`)
   - Optimized to collect all statistics (unused, duplicates, large files, missing alt) in one iteration
   - Returns `memory_limited` flag if scan was cut short

7. **Interface methods updated**
   - `scan_unused_media()` now returns `memory_limited` flag and uses `ORDER BY ID ASC`
   - Added `get_image_count()` private helper for image-only scans

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint check (should pass with only pre-existing warnings, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (should all pass)
npm test
```

The PHP unit tests in `tests/unit/MediaScannerTest.php` exercise the scanner methods but require a WordPress test environment to run.

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Breaking change awareness**: The `scan_all_media()` and `scan_unused_media()` return arrays now include a `memory_limited` boolean field. Consumers should handle this field to know if results are partial.

2. **Two-pass duplicate detection tradeoff**: The new approach trades memory for efficiency - it stores file paths grouped by size temporarily. For extremely large libraries (100k+ files), this could still consume significant memory, though less than hashing everything.

3. **Progress tracking granularity**: With the optimized interval-based progress updates (every 100 items), the frontend may see less frequent progress updates. Consider making `$progress_update_interval` configurable if finer granularity is needed.

4. **`get_media_summary()` is still expensive**: This method calls multiple full scans sequentially. Consider caching results or providing a single-pass variant for performance-critical use cases.
