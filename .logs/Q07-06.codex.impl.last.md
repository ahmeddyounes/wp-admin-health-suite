**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Made `preferred_time` validation explicit (`min`/`max`) and clarified it runs in the site timezone (`includes/Settings/Domain/SchedulingSettings.php:46`).
- Fixed scheduling updates to respect per-task enable toggles, avoid duplicate WP-Cron events (`wp_clear_scheduled_hook`), and compute next-run timestamps using the site timezone (`includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:789`, `includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:943`, `includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php:997`).
- Ensured fresh installs/activation can schedule `weekly`/`monthly` WP-Cron events by registering those schedules before initial scheduling, and made initial next-run timezone-aware (`includes/Installer.php:265`, `includes/Installer.php:367`).

**How to verify**
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

**Risks / follow-ups**
- Existing installs with already-scheduled events won’t be automatically “corrected” until scheduling settings are saved (or scheduler toggled) to trigger rescheduling.
- Weekly/monthly recurrence still uses fixed intervals (seconds), so DST changes can shift the local run time; consider DST-aware re-alignment if strict local-time execution is required.
