## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

### 1. `includes/database/RevisionsManager.php`
- **Added unpublished post protection**: By default, revisions of posts with status `draft`, `pending`, `auto-draft`, or `future` are protected from deletion. Added `$force` parameter to override this protection.
- **Added `PROTECTED_STATUSES` constant**: Defines which post statuses are considered protected.
- **Added `is_protected_status()` method**: Checks if a post status is protected, with a filter (`wpha_protected_revision_statuses`) to customize protected statuses.
- **Added post existence validation**: Methods now verify the parent post exists before attempting deletion.
- **Added recovery hooks**: 
  - `wpha_before_revisions_delete` - Fires before revisions are deleted (for backup)
  - `wpha_before_revision_delete` - Fires before each individual revision is deleted
  - `wpha_after_revisions_delete` - Fires after revisions are deleted
  - `wpha_revision_deletion_skipped_unpublished` - Fires when deletion is skipped for unpublished posts
  - `wpha_before_bulk_revisions_delete` - Fires before bulk deletion starts
  - `wpha_after_bulk_revisions_delete` - Fires after bulk deletion completes
- **Fixed batch processing**: Removed inefficient `wp_defer_term_counting` toggling within loops; now properly defers for the entire operation.
- **Added `skipped` return key**: Methods return a `skipped` reason when deletion is skipped.
- **Updated return arrays**: `delete_all_revisions()` now returns `skipped_posts` count.

### 2. `tests/unit/DatabaseAnalyzerTest.php`
- **Fixed dependency injection**: Added `WpdbConnection` import and properly instantiate all database classes with the required `ConnectionInterface` dependency.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Syntax check
php -l includes/database/RevisionsManager.php
php -l tests/unit/DatabaseAnalyzerTest.php

# PHP CodeSniffer
./vendor/bin/phpcs includes/database/RevisionsManager.php
./vendor/bin/phpcs tests/unit/DatabaseAnalyzerTest.php

# Lint (JS only - passes)
npm run lint

# Tests (JS tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Breaking change for existing callers**: The `delete_all_revisions()` method signature changed to include `$force` parameter and now returns `skipped_posts` in the result array. Existing code should continue to work since `$force` defaults to `false` and the original keys (`deleted`, `bytes_freed`) are still present.

2. **Test coverage**: The WordPress integration tests require a WordPress test environment to run. The existing tests in `DatabaseAnalyzerTest.php` will work once the WordPress test suite is installed (`bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh`).

3. **Performance consideration**: The new unpublished post protection adds a `get_post()` call per post being processed. For bulk operations with many posts, this could add overhead. However, this is a reasonable trade-off for data safety.

4. **Recovery hooks are passive**: The hooks provide opportunities for backup/logging but don't implement actual recovery storage. Consumers must implement their own backup strategy using these hooks.
