## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created the Application layer scaffolding for use-case classes as specified in the architecture improvement plan (Section 9.3):

### Directory Structure Created
```
includes/Application/
├── index.php
├── Database/
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── RunCleanup.php
│   └── RunOptimization.php
├── Media/
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── RunScan.php
│   └── ProcessDuplicates.php
├── Performance/
│   ├── index.php
│   ├── RunHealthCheck.php
│   └── CollectMetrics.php
└── AI/
    ├── index.php
    └── GenerateRecommendations.php
```

### Use-Case Class Shells (7 classes)
Each class follows the project's coding conventions with:
- PSR-4 compliant namespacing (`WPAdminHealth\Application\*`)
- WordPress `ABSPATH` security check
- PHPDoc blocks with `@since 1.4.0` tags
- Shell `execute(array $options = array()): array` method returning `['success' => false, 'message' => 'Not implemented yet.']`

### Documentation
- Created `docs/developers/application-layer.md` with:
  - Purpose and benefits of the Application layer
  - Directory structure reference
  - Usage patterns (from REST controllers and scheduled tasks)
  - Available use-cases table
  - Design guidelines for implementing use-cases
  - Reference to Phase 2 of architecture improvement plan

### Tests
- Created `tests/unit-standalone/Application/ApplicationLayerTest.php` with 15 tests verifying:
  - Each use-case class can be instantiated
  - Each `execute()` method returns the expected array structure
  - Methods accept options parameter

### Autoloading
- No changes needed - existing PSR-4 mapping (`WPAdminHealth\ -> includes/`) automatically covers new namespace

## How to Verify

```bash
# Regenerate autoload (optional - already done)
composer dump-autoload

# Run Application layer specific tests
composer test:standalone -- --filter=ApplicationLayerTest

# Run all standalone tests
composer test:standalone

# Run lint
npm run lint

# Run JS tests
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Pre-existing case sensitivity issue**: The file `includes/Integrations/Acf.php` should be renamed to `ACF.php` to match the class name `ACF`. This is a pre-existing issue not introduced by this task.

2. **Use-case implementations**: The shell classes return `['success' => false, 'message' => 'Not implemented yet.']`. Actual implementations will be added when REST controllers are refactored per Phase 2 of the architecture plan.

3. **Service Provider**: No service provider was created for Application layer services. This can be added when implementations are complete and DI is needed.
