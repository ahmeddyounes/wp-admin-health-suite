PSR-4 autoloading handles all classes correctly.\n- **Vendor warnings**: `composer dump-autoload` shows warnings about `League\\Flysystem\\FilesystemInterface` ambiguity from dev dependencies (phpdocumentor vs league/flysystem) - this is unrelated to our changes and is a known issue with the documentation generator.\n- The `autoload-dev` classmap for `tests/` directories remains unchanged and appropriate since test directories may contain classes that don't follow PSR-4 conventions.","session_id":"2a5dd1a4-76db-4183-906e-5488c4f09983","total_cost_usd":1.3552780000000004,"usage":{"input_tokens":843,"cache_creation_input_tokens":75002,"cache_read_input_tokens":1287165,"output_tokens":7568,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":75002}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":843,"outputTokens":7568,"cacheReadInputTokens":1287165,"cacheCreationInputTokens":75002,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.3057600000000003,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":42323,"outputTokens":1439,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.049518000000000006,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"ede47573-6401-4bdc-8529-5db634c75366"}
