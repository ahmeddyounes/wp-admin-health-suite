**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Added long-running task helpers to `includes/Scheduler/AbstractScheduledTask.php` (timeout setup/checks, progress load/save/clear, standardized exception logging + `execute_with_recovery()`).
- Refactored `includes/Database/Tasks/DatabaseCleanupTask.php` and `includes/Media/Tasks/MediaScanTask.php` to use the shared base implementations (removes duplicated timeout/progress/error-recovery code).
- Marked Q08-02 as completed in `.t2/state.json`.

**How to verify**
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

**Risks / follow-ups**
- Behavioral change: `time_limit` overrides now accept digit strings (e.g. `"25"`) in addition to ints; should be low-risk.
- No PHP test coverage here; if you want, I can add minimal PHP unit/smoke checks around the new base helpers.
