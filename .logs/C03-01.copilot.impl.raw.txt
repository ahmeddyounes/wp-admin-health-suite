I’ll read the C03-01 spec + handoff, then implement the required code changes and run lint/tests.

I’m going to locate existing locking and DI/container patterns, then add a LockService contract + implementation and bind it in the existing providers.

I’ll wire in a new LockService interface + implementation, then refactor existing GET_LOCK usage to use it and run the provided lint/tests.

I’ll add a LockService contract + implementation, wire it into the existing ServicesServiceProvider, then refactor SchedulerRegistry to use it and run lint/tests.

Implementing LockService contract + service, wiring it into the container, then switching existing scheduler/media locks to use it; after that I’ll run npm lint/tests.

Cleaning unrelated changes, then I’ll refactor existing scheduler/media locks to use the new LockService abstraction and rerun lint/tests.

I’m going to clean up the working tree so only the C03-01 lock abstraction changes remain.

Restoring tracked repo state (including `.logs/`) so only the C03-01 changes remain.

I’m going to implement the actual C03-01 spec (Application layer scaffolding), removing the unrelated untracked LockService files and adding the Application namespace + docs + tests, then run `npm run lint` and `npm test`.

I’m going to align the Application scaffolding with the C03-01 spec (missing Dashboard index + test coverage), then rerun the requested JS lint/tests.

I’ll add the missing Dashboard `index.php`, update the Application layer doc to include Dashboard, and extend the standalone ApplicationLayerTest to cover the Dashboard use-case; then rerun `npm run lint` and `npm test`.

Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Completed C03-01 “Application layer scaffolding” by ensuring `WPAdminHealth\\Application\\*` structure is consistent (added missing `includes/Application/Dashboard/index.php`).
- Updated `docs/developers/application-layer.md` to include the Dashboard module (`GetHealthScore`).
- Updated standalone unit test `ApplicationLayerTest` to assert `GetHealthScore` autoloads.

How to verify:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`
- `php -d memory_limit=512M vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit-standalone.xml --filter=ApplicationLayerTest`

Risks / follow-ups:
- Full `composer test:standalone` exhausts memory in this environment even at 512MB (pre-existing); only the filtered ApplicationLayerTest is reliably runnable here.
