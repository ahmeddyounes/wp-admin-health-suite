## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Enhanced `ActivityLoggerInterface` (`includes/Contracts/ActivityLoggerInterface.php`)
- Added `prune_old_logs(): int` method for log rotation
- Added `get_log_count(): int` method to get total log entries

### 2. Enhanced `ActivityLogger` (`includes/Services/ActivityLogger.php`)
- Added constants for log retention configuration:
  - `DEFAULT_LOG_TTL = 2592000` (30 days)
  - `DEFAULT_MAX_LOG_ROWS = 10000`
  - `PRUNE_TRANSIENT` for throttling auto-prune
- Added optional `SettingsInterface` dependency for configurable retention
- Implemented `prune_old_logs()` - TTL-based deletion with configurable retention (7-90 days)
- Implemented `get_log_count()` - returns total log entries
- Added `maybe_auto_prune()` - triggers pruning once per day via transient
- Added `enforce_max_rows()` - deletes oldest logs when exceeding max rows
- Added helper methods: `get_log_ttl_seconds()`, `get_max_log_rows()`

### 3. Updated Service Provider (`includes/Providers/ServicesServiceProvider.php`)
- Injects `SettingsInterface` into `ActivityLogger` for configurable retention settings

### 4. Created Test Infrastructure
- Created `MockSettings.php` for testing settings-dependent behavior
- Created `ActivityLoggerTest.php` with 24 tests covering:
  - Interface compliance
  - Log recording and sanitization
  - Database cleanup, media, and performance logging
  - Log retrieval with limits and type filters
  - Table existence caching
  - Log pruning with TTL
  - Retention days clamping (7-90 days)

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run linting (expect 0 errors)
npm run lint

# Run JavaScript tests (expect 101 tests passing)
npm test

# Run PHP standalone tests for ActivityLogger
vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit-standalone.xml tests/unit-standalone/Services/ActivityLoggerTest.php
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Scheduled Cleanup**: The auto-prune runs on log insertion (throttled to once/day). Consider adding a dedicated WP-Cron hook for scheduled cleanup independent of log activity.

2. **Settings Keys**: The implementation expects `log_retention_days` and `log_max_rows` settings keys. Ensure these are added to the settings UI and defaults.

3. **Database Performance**: For high-volume sites, the `enforce_max_rows()` method with `ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET X` pattern may benefit from an index on `id`. The existing table schema should handle this well.

4. **Integration Testing**: The unit tests use mocks. Integration tests with a real database would provide additional confidence.
