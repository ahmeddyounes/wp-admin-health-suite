## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

This was a **review task** for `includes/REST/RestController.php`. The base controller implementation was already well-designed. I made one fix:

### Fix Applied
- **Fixed inconsistent docblock indentation** in 6 method docblocks (lines ~128, 185, 197, 210, 222, 628). These had missing leading tabs on `@since` annotations, which was inconsistent with the rest of the file's coding style.

### Review Findings (All Good)

1. **Base class structure**: Properly extends `WP_REST_Controller`, defines sensible defaults, uses dependency injection

2. **Permission/authentication**: 
   - Checks REST API enabled status
   - Validates user authentication (401)
   - Checks `manage_options` capability (403)
   - Verifies nonce via `X-WP-Nonce` header
   - Applies rate limiting

3. **Rate limiting**: 
   - Uses atomic operations with object cache when available
   - Falls back to transient-based locking for non-persistent cache sites
   - Implements fail-closed security (503 when limiter unavailable)

4. **Error handling**: 
   - `format_error_response()` provides consistent error structure
   - Includes error codes and data when available
   - Returns proper HTTP status codes

5. **Response formatting**: 
   - `format_response()` provides consistent structure
   - Debug info is security-controlled (only for admins with WPHA_DEBUG)
   - Query text never exposed, only query types

6. **Security**: No SQL injection issues (uses prepared statements), proper input sanitization

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run PHPStan
vendor/bin/phpstan analyze --memory-limit=512M includes/REST/RestController.php

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **None**: This was a review task with a minor formatting fix. No functional changes were made.
