**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

1. **Fixed casing mismatches in `includes/RestApi.php`** (lines 72, 78, 86, 95, 109, 124):
   - Changed all 6 `require_once` paths from `includes/rest/` to `includes/REST/` to match the actual filesystem casing
   - This fixes potential issues on case-sensitive filesystems (Linux production servers)

2. **Added documentation in `docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md`**:
   - Added "Enforced Casing Rule" subsection under section 2.1
   - Documents the requirement that all manual `require_once` paths must use exact-case matching the filesystem
   - Provides examples of correct vs incorrect paths
   - Notes that this change was made as part of C01-07

## Files Modified

- `includes/RestApi.php` - Fixed 6 `require_once` paths (rest → REST)
- `docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md` - Added enforced casing rule documentation

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (should pass with warnings only)
npm run lint

# Run tests (should all pass)
npm test

# Verify the require_once paths match actual directories
ls -la includes/ | grep -i rest
# Should show: REST (uppercase directory), RestApi.php (file)

# Confirm no lowercase 'rest/' paths remain in RestApi.php
grep -n "includes/rest/" includes/RestApi.php
# Should return nothing (no matches)

# Confirm uppercase 'REST/' paths are used
grep -n "includes/REST/" includes/RestApi.php
# Should show 6 matches at lines 72, 78, 86, 95, 109, 124
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low risk**: These changes only affect path strings in manual require statements. The actual directory and files remain unchanged.
- **Follow-up**: The `includes/Admin.php` file at line 82 also has a manual `require_once` for `admin/Admin.php` - this path is correct (lowercase `admin/` directory exists), but should be reviewed during the Phase 1 work to move admin code into autoloaded namespace.
- **CI Consideration**: Consider adding a CI step that detects case-only path issues on Linux as mentioned in the architecture plan Phase 0.
