Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Updated database cleanup settings: safer defaults (`revisions_to_keep` now defaults to 5), clarified field descriptions, switched orphaned cleanup to `orphaned_cleanup_enabled`, and added stricter sanitization for `excluded_transient_prefixes` (`newline_list`, max 100). (`includes/Settings/Domain/DatabaseSettings.php`)
- Improved settings validation globally: integer inputs now clamp correctly (no more `-1` becoming `1`), added `newline_list` sanitizer, and migrated legacy `cleanup_orphaned_metadata` → `orphaned_cleanup_enabled`. (`includes/Settings/SettingsRegistry.php`)
- Aligned scheduled database cleanup behavior with settings: scheduled transients cleanup honors excluded prefixes; spam/trash cleanup honors retention days and per-type toggles; added auto-drafts cleanup (older than 7 days by default) and extended task schema for manual overrides. (`includes/Database/Tasks/DatabaseCleanupTask.php`)
- Added standalone coverage for the new sanitization + migration behavior and a missing stub used by the new sanitizer. (`tests/unit-standalone/Settings/SettingsRegistryTest.php`, `tests/bootstrap-standalone.php`)

How to verify:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups:
- Scheduled trash/spam cleanup now only runs when the corresponding retention days setting is `> 0`; if someone previously relied on “delete everything” behavior, they’ll need to set retention days or run manually.
- Auto-drafts cleanup uses a fixed 7-day threshold; consider making this configurable if needed.
- Integer sanitization behavior changed globally (negative/non-numeric now clamps to min/default instead of `absint` behavior); worth a quick spot-check of any settings that might have depended on the old behavior.
