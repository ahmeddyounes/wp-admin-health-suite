Great! The documentation includes 11 warning callouts for irreversible actions and safety considerations. Now let me create a summary of the implementation:

---

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully created comprehensive user documentation for the database cleanup feature at `docs/database-cleanup.md` (55KB, 2,218 lines).

### Documentation Structure

The guide includes all required sections from the specification:

1. **Understanding Database Bloat** - Explains what database bloat is, why it matters, how to identify it, and the safe cleanup philosophy
2. **Post Revisions** - Covers what revisions are, why to keep them, why to clean them, recommended retention counts, and step-by-step cleanup instructions
3. **Transients** - Explains WordPress transient caching, types of transients, safe cleanup procedures, and prevention strategies
4. **Spam and Trash** - Details spam comment removal and trashed content cleanup with safety considerations
5. **Orphaned Data** - Comprehensive coverage of orphaned postmeta, commentmeta, termmeta, and term relationships with technical details
6. **Table Optimization** - Explains database overhead, optimization process, benefits, and scheduling strategies
7. **Scheduling Automated Cleanups** - Complete guide to automation including WP-Cron, Action Scheduler, and recommended schedules for different site types
8. **Best Practices** - Workflow recommendations, safety-first approach, performance tips, common mistakes to avoid, and site-specific guidelines

### Key Features

- **11 warning callouts** for irreversible actions and safety considerations
- **Step-by-step instructions** with clear "How to" sections for each cleanup type
- **Risk level indicators** (Very Low, Low, Moderate) for each operation
- **Recommended settings tables** for different site types (personal blog, business, e-commerce, etc.)
- **Safety checklists** before and after cleanup operations
- **Troubleshooting sections** for common issues
- **Visual formatting** with tables, code blocks, and structured lists
- **Progressive disclosure** from basic to advanced topics
- **Real-world examples** and analogies for complex concepts

### Style Consistency

The documentation follows the same style and tone as the existing `docs/getting-started.md`:
- Uses the same header hierarchy and formatting
- Includes similar table structures and callout styles
- Maintains consistent technical depth
- Uses practical examples and user-friendly language

## How to Verify

```bash
# Verify file exists and size
ls -lh docs/database-cleanup.md

# Check main sections are present
grep "^## " docs/database-cleanup.md

# Verify line count (should be 2,218 lines)
wc -l docs/database-cleanup.md

# Run lint (passes with warnings only)
npm run lint

# Run tests (passes)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

**No risks identified.** This is pure documentation with no code changes.

**Potential follow-ups:**
1. Add screenshots to illustrate the UI elements mentioned in the guide
2. Create a quick reference card/cheat sheet for common cleanup operations
3. Add links to this guide from the plugin UI (Database Health page)
4. Consider translating to other languages for international users
5. Create video tutorials to complement the written documentation

The documentation is production-ready and provides users with all the information needed to make informed decisions about database cleanup operations.
