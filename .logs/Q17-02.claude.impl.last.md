**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive ESLint configuration review document at `docs/eslint-configuration-review.md` covering:

1. **Configuration Overview**: Analysis of the `.eslintrc.json` structure with env, extends, parserOptions, plugins, and settings
2. **WordPress Coding Standards Compliance**: Review of `@wordpress/eslint-plugin` integration and inherited rules
3. **React/JSX Rules**: Evaluation of `react/react-in-jsx-scope: "off"` (correct for React 17+), `react/prop-types: "warn"`, and hooks rules
4. **JSX Accessibility Rules**: Analysis of jsx-a11y rules downgraded to warnings
5. **JSDoc Configuration**: Review of `jsdoc/require-param-type: "warn"` with 77 current violations
6. **Other Rules**: Assessment of `no-console: "off"`, `no-alert: "warn"`, `no-unused-vars: "warn"`
7. **Global Variables**: Validation of `jQuery`, `wp`, `wpAdminHealthData`, `Chart` declarations
8. **Ignore Patterns**: Confirmation that `assets/js/dist/`, `node_modules/`, `*.min.js` are appropriate
9. **Test File Overrides**: Review of Jest environment configuration
10. **Recommendations**: Prioritized improvements (JSDoc types, prop-types, native alerts, unused variables)

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint (will show 161 warnings, 0 errors)
npm run lint

# Tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test

# View the review document
cat docs/eslint-configuration-review.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **161 warnings outstanding**: The review documents these but does not fix them. The warnings are from:
   - 77 missing JSDoc `@param {type}` annotations
   - 50+ missing React prop-types validations
   - 6 native `alert()`/`confirm()` usages
   - 3 unused variables
   - 3 `@wordpress/no-unused-vars-before-return` violations

2. **Test console warnings**: Some React tests show `act()` warnings and `defaultProps` deprecation notices. These are pre-existing issues unrelated to ESLint configuration.

3. **Rule severity**: Several rules are set to `warn` that should be `error` before production. The review recommends elevating these after addressing the current warnings.
