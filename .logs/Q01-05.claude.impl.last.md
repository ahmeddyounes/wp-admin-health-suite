## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Reviewed and improved all 24 interfaces in `includes/Contracts/` for proper abstraction, method signatures, return type declarations, and documentation. Specifically improved documentation on 14 interfaces:

### Interfaces Updated:

1. **AltTextCheckerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed PHPDoc array shapes for return types
2. **ReferenceFinderInterface** - Added `@since` tags, descriptive comments, detailed array shapes
3. **AutoloadAnalyzerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed PHPDoc array shapes for all methods
4. **QueryMonitorInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed array shapes for queries and statistics
5. **PluginProfilerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed array shapes for profiling results
6. **DuplicateDetectorInterface** - Added `@since` tags, options parameter shapes, detailed return types
7. **OptimizerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed optimization result shapes
8. **ExclusionsInterface** - Added `@since` tags, typed array parameters and detailed return shapes
9. **SafeDeleteInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed soft-delete result shapes
10. **LargeFilesInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed file info and distribution shapes
11. **RevisionsManagerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, detailed revision data shapes
12. **TransientsCleanerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, typed array parameters, detailed shapes
13. **TrashCleanerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, typed parameters, detailed result shapes
14. **OrphanedCleanerInterface** - Added `@since` tags, descriptive comments, detailed return types

### Key Improvements:

1. **Documentation**: All methods now have `@since` version tags
2. **PHPDoc Array Shapes**: Added specific array shape annotations like `array{success: bool, message: string}` for better IDE support and type safety
3. **Interface Descriptions**: Enhanced interface-level docblocks to explain purpose
4. **Method Descriptions**: Added clarifying comments where the method name wasn't self-explanatory
5. **Parameter Types**: Added typed array parameters using `array<int>` and `array<string>` syntax

### ISP Analysis:
The interfaces follow ISP appropriately. While some interfaces like `AnalyzerInterface` (17 methods) and `ConnectionInterface` (28+ methods) are large, they represent cohesive abstractions for their domains. Splitting them would create artificial boundaries between related operations.

## How to Verify

```bash
npm run lint    # Should pass with warnings only (no errors)
npm test        # Should pass all 101 tests
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low Risk**: Documentation changes only - no functional code changes
- **Future Consideration**: Could consider adding PHP 8 union types (e.g., `int|false`) to method signatures when PHP 8.0 becomes the minimum required version
- **Future Consideration**: The pre-existing lint warnings in JS files are unrelated to this task
