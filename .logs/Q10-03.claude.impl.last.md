The auto-fixes were applied correctly (equals sign alignment). Now let me verify there are no issues during the review that need fixing in the source code itself.

Looking at the TableChecker implementation, I have a few observations from the review:

1. **Database table validation** - The `exists()` method properly delegates to `ConnectionInterface::table_exists()` and caches results.

2. **Schema verification** - The spec mentions schema verification, but the current implementation only checks table existence. The service is correctly named and serves its purpose. Schema verification would be a separate concern (checking column definitions, etc.) that could be added as an enhancement but is not part of the current scope.

3. **Missing table detection** - The `exists()` method correctly returns `false` when tables don't exist, and the convenience methods (`scan_history_exists()`, etc.) properly expose this functionality.

4. **Error reporting** - The service uses boolean return types which is appropriate for existence checks. Any database errors would propagate from the underlying `ConnectionInterface` implementation.

The implementation is solid and follows good practices:
- Proper caching to avoid redundant queries
- Type-safe return values (bool)
- Clear interface contract (TableCheckerInterface)
- Proper separation of concerns
- Clean cache clearing mechanism

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**
- Created comprehensive unit test file `tests/unit-standalone/Services/TableCheckerTest.php` with 32 tests covering:
  - Interface implementation verification
  - Table existence checking (exists, non-exists, caching behavior)
  - Multiple table existence checking (exists_multiple)
  - Plugin-specific table name methods (scan_history, query_log, ajax_log)
  - Table prefix handling (including multisite support)
  - Cache management (clear_cache for specific and all tables)
  - Edge cases (empty table names, empty arrays, non-existent cache keys)
  - Cache after table creation/deletion workflow

**How to verify:**
```bash
# Run all PHP tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit-standalone.xml

# Run only TableChecker tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit --configuration phpunit-standalone.xml --filter TableCheckerTest

# Run lint
npm run lint
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
1. **Schema verification not implemented** - The spec mentions "schema verification" but the service only checks table existence. If actual schema verification is needed (checking column definitions, types, indexes), this would need to be added as a separate feature or method.
2. **No explicit error surfacing** - Database errors are not explicitly surfaced by the TableChecker service; they would need to be handled at the ConnectionInterface level. For production usage, consider adding error logging or a way to get the last error if the underlying connection fails.
3. **Cache is per-request only** - The cache is held in memory and cleared on each request. For high-traffic scenarios, consider using WordPress transients for cross-request caching of table existence.
