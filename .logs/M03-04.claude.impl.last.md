Perfect! Everything is implemented correctly. Let me provide the final summary:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

Created `/includes/media/class-large-files.php` implementing the Large File Identifier feature with the following components:

### Implemented Methods:

1. **find_large_files($threshold_kb = null)**
   - Default threshold: 500KB
   - Returns array of large files with:
     - ID, filename, current size (bytes & formatted)
     - Suggested max size (bytes & formatted)
     - Potential savings (bytes & formatted)
     - Dimensions (width, height) for images
     - MIME type

2. **get_optimization_suggestions()**
   - Identifies actionable optimization opportunities:
     - **Images over 2000px**: Detects oversized dimensions on either axis
     - **Unoptimized formats**: Identifies BMP and TIFF files
     - **PNGs that should be JPGs**: Detects PNGs without transparency over 100KB
   - Returns suggestions with type, priority, message, and recommended action

3. **get_size_distribution()**
   - Categorizes files into buckets:
     - <100KB
     - 100-500KB
     - 500KB-1MB
     - 1-5MB
     - >5MB
   - Returns count and total size (bytes & formatted) per bucket

### Additional Features:

- Batch processing (50 attachments per batch) for performance
- Helper method `calculate_optimization()` for estimating potential savings
- Helper method `check_png_transparency()` using GD library to detect alpha channels
- Follows WordPress coding standards and existing codebase patterns
- Proper namespacing: `WPAdminHealth\Media`
- Security check: `ABSPATH` constant verification

## How to verify

The file has been created and staged in git. To verify:

```bash
# Check that the file exists
ls -lh includes/media/class-large-files.php

# View the file
cat includes/media/class-large-files.php

# Verify it's staged
git status

# Run linting (currently not configured)
npm run lint

# Run tests (currently not configured)
npm test
```

To test functionality in WordPress:
```php
// Example usage in WordPress context
$large_files = new \WPAdminHealth\Media\Large_Files();

// Find files larger than 500KB (default)
$files = $large_files->find_large_files();

// Find files larger than 1MB
$files = $large_files->find_large_files(1024);

// Get optimization suggestions
$suggestions = $large_files->get_optimization_suggestions();

// Get size distribution
$distribution = $large_files->get_size_distribution();
```

## Risks / follow-ups

1. **PNG transparency detection**: Uses GD library which may not be available on all servers. Falls back to assuming no transparency if GD is unavailable.

2. **Batch processing**: Processes 50 attachments at a time. For very large media libraries (10,000+ files), consider adding progress tracking similar to the Scanner class.

3. **Performance**: The `get_optimization_suggestions()` method checks PNG transparency using GD, which can be resource-intensive for large PNGs. Consider caching results.

4. **Testing**: No automated tests configured yet. Should add unit tests for:
   - Threshold calculations
   - Size bucket categorization
   - Optimization suggestions logic
   - PNG transparency detection

5. **Integration**: This class needs to be integrated into:
   - REST API endpoints for frontend consumption
   - Admin UI for displaying results
   - Autoloader to ensure the class is available
