Perfect! Now let me create a brief summary document verifying the implementation:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

Created `/includes/database/class-orphaned-tables.php` implementing a comprehensive Orphaned Tables Detector with the following features:

### Implemented Methods:

1. **get_all_wp_tables()** - Retrieves all database tables with the WordPress prefix using information_schema.TABLES

2. **get_known_core_tables()** - Returns a complete list of WordPress core tables including:
   - Standard WP tables (posts, postmeta, comments, etc.)
   - Multisite-specific tables (blogs, blogmeta, site, sitemeta, etc.)

3. **get_registered_plugin_tables()** - Identifies plugin tables through:
   - Common plugin table patterns (WooCommerce, Contact Form 7, Yoast SEO, Wordfence, etc.)
   - Custom filter hook `wpha_registered_plugin_tables` for extensibility
   - Pattern matching for popular plugins to prevent false positives

4. **find_orphaned_tables()** - Detects orphaned tables by:
   - Comparing all WP tables against known core and plugin tables
   - Returning detailed information (name, size, row count, timestamps)
   - Including confirmation hash for safe deletion

5. **delete_orphaned_table($table_name, $confirm_hash)** - Safely deletes tables with:
   - **Mandatory confirmation hash verification** (no auto-deletion)
   - Multiple safety checks (prefix validation, core table protection, sanitization)
   - Pre-deletion validation and logging
   - Returns detailed success/failure information with size freed

### Safety Features:

- Hash-based confirmation (8-char MD5 using AUTH_KEY)
- Multiple validation layers before deletion
- Core table protection
- SQL injection prevention through sanitization
- Detailed logging to scan_history table
- Comprehensive error messages

## How to verify

### Syntax check:
```bash
php -l includes/database/class-orphaned-tables.php
```

### Lint (when configured):
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Tests (when configured):
```bash
npm test
```

### Manual verification:
The class can be instantiated and tested in WordPress context:
```php
$detector = new \WPAdminHealth\Database\Orphaned_Tables();
$orphaned = $detector->find_orphaned_tables();
```

## Risks / follow-ups

**Risks:**
1. **Plugin detection relies on pattern matching** - Some less common plugins with non-standard table naming may be flagged as orphaned
2. **Multisite compatibility** - Tested for multisite detection but may need real-world multisite testing
3. **No undo mechanism** - Once deleted, tables cannot be recovered (by design, but worth noting)

**Follow-ups:**
1. Add unit tests for all methods
2. Consider adding table backup before deletion option
3. Add admin UI to display orphaned tables with deletion interface
4. Expand plugin table patterns as more plugins are discovered
5. Add phpcs/WordPress coding standards linting
6. Consider adding a "whitelist" feature for custom tables users want to keep

**Documentation needs:**
- Usage examples in code comments or README
- Filter hook documentation for `wpha_registered_plugin_tables`
