## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

1. **Created ADR-001** (`docs/decisions/ADR-001-code-organization.md`) — Architecture Decision Record documenting the code organization strategy:
   - **Decision**: Stay in `includes/` (Option A) rather than migrating to `src/` (Option B)
   - **Rationale**: Minimal disruption, WordPress ecosystem alignment, no backward compatibility wrappers needed, preserves git history
   - **New namespace structure**: `WPAdminHealth\Application\*` and `WPAdminHealth\Infrastructure\*` to be added incrementally
   - **Deprecation policy**: Keep originals for one minor version, use `_doing_it_wrong()` notices, document in CHANGELOG

2. **Updated `docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md`**:
   - Marked question #2 (directory migration) as **DECIDED**
   - Added **Section 9** with full decision details including summary, rationale table, namespace structure, migration rules, deprecation policy, and acceptance criteria

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint (no new errors introduced - existing warnings are pre-existing)
npm run lint

# Tests (all 417 pass)
npm test

# Review the decision documents
cat docs/decisions/ADR-001-code-organization.md
cat docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md | grep -A 60 "## 9) Decided"
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **None identified** — This task is purely documentation. No code changes were made.
- **Follow-up**: When implementing Phase 2 of the architecture plan, create the `includes/Application/` and `includes/Infrastructure/` directories following the structure documented in the ADR.
