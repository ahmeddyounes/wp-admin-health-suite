**Status:** DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created `docs/code-quality-documentation-review.md` - a comprehensive code quality documentation review covering:

1. **PHPCS Configuration** (`phpcs.xml`)
   - Documented all analyzed paths and exclusions
   - Listed WordPress-Extra, WordPress-Docs, and PHPCompatibilityWP standards
   - Explained intentional rule exclusions (PSR-4 compatibility, false positive prevention)
   - Documented PHP 7.4+ and WordPress 5.8+ version requirements
   - Covered text domain and global prefix configurations

2. **PHPStan Configuration** (`phpstan.neon`, `phpstan-bootstrap.php`, `phpstan-baseline.neon`)
   - Documented Level 5 analysis configuration
   - Explained bootstrap file purpose for constant definitions
   - Summarized 35 baseline entries by category
   - Covered global ignore patterns for WP stubs

3. **ESLint Configuration** (`.eslintrc.json`)
   - Documented environments, extended configs, and plugins
   - Listed all custom rule overrides with explanations
   - Covered global variables (jQuery, wp, wpAdminHealthData, Chart)
   - Documented ignore patterns and test file overrides

4. **Prettier Configuration** (`.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierignore`)
   - Documented all formatting settings (tabs, quotes, semicolons, etc.)
   - Covered JSON/YAML file overrides
   - Listed ignored directories and files

5. **Pre-commit Hooks** (`.husky/pre-commit`, lint-staged)
   - Documented Husky pre-commit workflow
   - Covered lint-staged configuration for JS/CSS/PHP files

6. **Coding Standards Reference**
   - PHP naming conventions (classes, methods, hooks, prefixes)
   - JavaScript naming conventions (components, functions)
   - Text domain usage

7. **Recommendations Section**
   - Identified existing strengths
   - Suggested potential improvements (PHPStan level increase, baseline reduction, DB_NAME fix)

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run ESLint (warnings expected, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run Jest tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **ESLint warnings (161)**: Mostly JSDoc `@param` type missing and React PropTypes warnings - these are configured as warnings, not errors
2. **PHPStan baseline (35 entries)**: Documented in the review; could be gradually reduced by fixing `DB_NAME` constant and PHPDoc syntax issues
3. **React defaultProps deprecation**: Some components still use `defaultProps` which will be removed in future React versions - documented for awareness
4. **Test async/act warnings**: ActivityTimeline tests have minor async state update warnings - not blocking but could be improved
