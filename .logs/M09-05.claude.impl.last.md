Perfect! Let me create a quick summary document:

## Status: DONE

### Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented M09-05 by creating comprehensive integration tests in `/tests/test-integration.php`. The test file includes:

**Complete Workflow Tests:**
1. **Database Scan to Cleanup Workflow** - Tests the full lifecycle from creating test data, scanning the database, configuring cleanup settings, executing cleanup, and verifying results are stored in scan history.

2. **Media Scan to Cleanup Workflow** - Tests media library scanning from creating test attachments through scanning and verifying results.

3. **Scheduled Task Execution Workflow** - Tests scheduling cleanup tasks, verifying tasks are scheduled, executing them, verifying execution updates, and unscheduling tasks.

4. **Settings Changes Affecting Behavior** - Tests that changing settings properly affects plugin behavior, including enabling/disabling cleanup options, safe mode, and scheduler settings.

5. **Scheduled Task Creation via Settings** - Tests that updating scheduling settings triggers proper task creation and deletion.

**Plugin Compatibility Tests:**
6. **WooCommerce Compatibility** - Tests that the plugin works correctly with WooCommerce active, including scanning product images and database analysis with product post types.

7. **Elementor Compatibility** - Tests that the plugin works correctly with Elementor active, including scanning Elementor page builder content and images.

8. **No Conflicts Test** - Verifies the plugin initializes without conflicts and doesn't break core WordPress functionality.

**Additional Integration Tests:**
9. **Email Notifications** - Tests that email notification settings are properly configured.

10. **Complete End-to-End Workflow** - Tests the full workflow from configuring settings, creating test data, scanning, cleanup execution, and verification.

11. **Settings Import/Export Workflow** - Tests the settings export and import functionality.

### Test Coverage

The test file includes **11 comprehensive test methods** covering:
- Full scan to cleanup workflows
- Scheduled task execution and management  
- Settings changes affecting plugin behavior
- WooCommerce integration
- Elementor integration
- No conflicts with popular plugins
- Email notifications
- End-to-end workflows
- Settings import/export

### How to Verify

**Exact commands:**

1. **Check syntax (already verified):**
   ```bash
   php -l tests/test-integration.php
   ```
   Result: ✅ No syntax errors detected

2. **Run linting (already verified):**
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```
   Result: ✅ 0 errors, 42 warnings (all JavaScript prop-types, not related to this task)

3. **Run tests (requires WordPress test environment):**
   ```bash
   # First, set up WordPress test environment:
   bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost latest
   
   # Then run tests:
   vendor/bin/phpunit
   
   # Or run just the integration tests:
   vendor/bin/phpunit tests/test-integration.php
   ```

**Note:** The WordPress test suite must be installed before tests can run. The test file is syntactically correct and follows the same structure as existing tests in the project.

### Risks / Follow-ups

**Risks:**
- Low risk - Test file follows established patterns from existing tests (test-rest-api.php, test-database-analyzer.php)
- No production code was modified, only tests were added
- All tests use proper setup/teardown to avoid side effects

**Follow-ups:**
- Install WordPress test environment to run the full test suite
- Consider adding more edge cases for specific plugin compatibility scenarios
- May want to add performance benchmarks for large datasets in future iterations

### File Created
- `tests/test-integration.php` (19KB) - Comprehensive integration test suite with 11 test methods covering workflows, scheduled tasks, settings, and plugin compatibility
