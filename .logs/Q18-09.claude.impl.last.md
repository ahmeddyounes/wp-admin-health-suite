**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive exception handling review document at `docs/exception-handling-review.md` that covers:

1. **Exception Hierarchy Analysis**: Documented the inheritance structure with `WPAdminHealthException` as the base class and three domain-specific exceptions (`DatabaseException`, `MediaException`, `ValidationException`)

2. **PSR-11 Container Exceptions**: Reviewed `ContainerException` and `NotFoundException` which provide DI container error handling

3. **Error Codes Catalog**: Documented 18 error code constants across all exception classes with their corresponding HTTP status codes

4. **Factory Methods Documentation**: Documented 15 named factory methods that provide semantic exception creation

5. **Security Features**: Identified security best practices including:
   - Input sanitization via `sanitize_text_field()`
   - Value truncation (100 chars for queries/values)
   - Path security (exposing only basenames)
   - Safe message generation that hides sensitive paths

6. **WordPress Integration**: Documented `WP_Error` and `WP_REST_Response` conversion capabilities

7. **Usage Analysis**: Identified that the `includes/Exceptions/` exceptions are well-designed but not yet actively used in the codebase (primarily `ContainerException` and `NotFoundException` are used)

8. **Recommendations**: Provided short, medium, and long-term improvement suggestions

## How to Verify

```bash
# View the documentation
cat docs/exception-handling-review.md

# Run lint (existing warnings - not related to this task)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Low Risk**: The lint warnings shown are pre-existing JSDoc and prop-types warnings unrelated to this review task

2. **Follow-up Opportunity**: The domain exceptions (`DatabaseException`, `MediaException`, `ValidationException`) are well-designed but not yet adopted in the codebase. Future tasks could focus on integrating them in `includes/Database/`, `includes/Media/`, and REST API handlers

3. **Missing Factory Methods**: `ERROR_COLUMN_NOT_FOUND` and `ERROR_UPLOAD_FAILED` constants are defined but lack corresponding factory methods
