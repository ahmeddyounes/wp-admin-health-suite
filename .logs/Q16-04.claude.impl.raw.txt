Verified implementation in Database/Analyzer.php and Media/Scanner.php.\n\n2. **Optimization Strategies** - Analyzed lazy loading CSS, async/defer JavaScript, N+1 query prevention, batch processing, generator usage, memory monitoring, and progress tracking. All documented strategies verified in actual code.\n\n3. **Large Site Handling Guidance** - Evaluated batch processor documentation, generator-based iteration, configurable batch sizes, memory awareness (80% threshold), and timeout prevention. Confirmed support for 100k+ posts.\n\nThe review found the PERFORMANCE.md documentation to be **Excellent** overall, with accurate implementation matching documentation claims. Minor recommendations for enhancement were provided (documenting memory threshold configuration, server requirements, and progress update intervals).\n\n## How to Verify\n\n```bash\n# Check the review file was created\ncat docs/performance-documentation-review.md\n\n# Run linting (pre-existing warnings only)\nnpm run lint\n\n# Run tests (all 417 tests pass)\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n- **None identified** - This is a documentation review task that created a new markdown file. No code changes were made.\n- **Low Priority Enhancement** - The review identifies several minor documentation improvements that could be made to PERFORMANCE.md in a future task (documenting 80% memory threshold, progress update intervals, server configuration guidance).","session_id":"e449e433-557c-4cbe-8e7d-dfdf0e38e684","total_cost_usd":1.05330375,"usage":{"input_tokens":6706,"cache_creation_input_tokens":72649,"cache_read_input_tokens":797577,"output_tokens":6338,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":72649}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":6706,"outputTokens":6338,"cacheReadInputTokens":797577,"cacheCreationInputTokens":72649,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.0448247499999999,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":7809,"outputTokens":134,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.008479,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"8e6e8839-caee-4af2-b73f-c6011d73cdfe"}
