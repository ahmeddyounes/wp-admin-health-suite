Let me provide a summary of what I changed:

---

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Added `schedule_initial_tasks()` method to `SchedulingServiceInterface` (`includes/Scheduler/Contracts/SchedulingServiceInterface.php`)
- Added new interface method for scheduling initial tasks on fresh install
- Returns an array with `scheduled`, `skipped`, and `errors` keys

### 2. Implemented `schedule_initial_tasks()` in `SchedulingService` (`includes/Scheduler/SchedulingService.php`)
- Checks if scheduler is globally enabled, skipping all tasks if not
- Iterates through task config and schedules each enabled task
- Respects individual task enabled settings and frequency settings
- Fires `wpha_initial_tasks_scheduled` action hook after completion

### 3. Refactored `Installer.php` to use `SchedulingService`
- Added `SchedulingServiceInterface` property and setter/getter methods
- Updated `schedule_initial_tasks()` to delegate to `SchedulingService` when available
- Extracted custom cron schedule registration to `register_custom_cron_schedules()` method
- Created `schedule_initial_tasks_fallback()` for when the service isn't available (during activation)
- Maintains backward compatibility when DI container isn't initialized

### 4. Added tests for scheduling decisions (`tests/unit-standalone/Scheduler/SchedulingServiceTest.php`)
- `test_schedule_initial_tasks_skips_all_when_scheduler_disabled`: Verifies all tasks are skipped when scheduler is disabled
- `test_schedule_initial_tasks_returns_correct_structure`: Verifies correct return structure
- `test_schedule_initial_tasks_respects_enabled_settings`: Verifies tasks respect their enabled settings
- `test_schedule_initial_tasks_respects_frequency_disabled`: Verifies tasks with 'disabled' frequency are skipped

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run JavaScript tests (includes lint)
npm run lint
npm test

# Run PHP standalone tests (SchedulingService tests)
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit-standalone.xml tests/unit-standalone/Scheduler/SchedulingServiceTest.php
```

Expected results:
- `npm run lint`: Warnings only (no errors)
- `npm test`: 417 tests passing
- PHP standalone tests for SchedulingService: 14 tests passing

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Pre-existing PHPCS error**: There's an empty catch statement at line 297 in `Installer.php` in the `clear_table_checker_cache()` method. This is a pre-existing issue in the working directory, not introduced by this task.

2. **Pre-existing test failures**: 8 PHP standalone test failures exist in other test files (ApplicationLayerTest, ExceptionsTest) due to missing WordPress functions or constructor argument changes. These are unrelated to this task.

3. **Testing in WordPress context**: The full integration testing requires a WordPress test database setup. The standalone tests verify the logic, but testing the actual activation flow requires running in WordPress context.
