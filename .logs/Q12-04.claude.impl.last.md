## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

### `assets/js/components/ActivityTimeline.jsx`
Comprehensive review and improvements to the Activity Timeline component:

1. **Timeline Rendering Performance**:
   - Moved all style objects outside the component to prevent recreation on each render
   - Added `memo()` wrapper to `ActivityItem` component for memoization
   - Used `useMemo()` for computed values (totalPages, displayedActivities)
   - Used `useCallback()` for all event handlers (fetchActivities, handlePageChange, handleRefresh)

2. **Date Formatting**:
   - Added validation for null/undefined date strings → returns "Unknown time"
   - Added validation for invalid date strings → returns "Invalid date"  
   - Added handling for future dates → returns "In the future"

3. **Pagination** (was missing):
   - Added `Pagination` component with previous/next navigation
   - Added `pageSize` prop (default: 10)
   - API calls now include `page` and `per_page` query parameters
   - Tracks `currentPage` and `totalItems` state
   - Pagination hidden when only 1 page of results

4. **Real-time Updates** (was missing):
   - Added `autoRefresh` prop (default: true)
   - Added `refreshInterval` prop (default: 30000ms)
   - Implemented auto-refresh with `setInterval`
   - Added manual refresh button in header
   - Separate `refreshing` state to distinguish from initial load

5. **Performance Safeguards**:
   - Added `maxItems` limit (100) to prevent rendering too many items
   - Input validation in `formatBytes` for negative/NaN/non-number values

6. **Accessibility Improvements**:
   - Added `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"` for loading state
   - Added `role="alert"` for error state
   - Added `aria-label="Activity timeline"` on the list
   - Added `aria-label="Activity pagination"` on pagination nav
   - Added `aria-label` on Previous/Next buttons
   - Added `aria-hidden="true"` on decorative icons

7. **PropTypes**:
   - Added proper PropTypes for all components and sub-components
   - Added defaultProps with sensible defaults

### `assets/js/components/ActivityTimeline.test.jsx`
Extended test suite with 53 tests (up from ~30):

- Added tests for pagination (show/hide, navigation, disabled states)
- Added tests for auto-refresh (interval triggers, disabled state, manual refresh)
- Added tests for `formatBytes` edge cases (negative, NaN, non-numbers)
- Added tests for `getRelativeTime` edge cases (null, invalid, future dates)
- Added accessibility tests (ARIA labels, roles)
- Exported `formatBytes` and `getRelativeTime` for direct testing

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (no errors on ActivityTimeline files)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 159 pass, including 53 ActivityTimeline tests)
npm test

# Run only ActivityTimeline tests
npm test -- --testPathPattern="ActivityTimeline"
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **React 18 Warning**: The `defaultProps` pattern triggers a deprecation warning in React 18. For future compatibility, consider migrating to default parameters in function signatures. This is a low-risk warning that doesn't affect functionality.

2. **Server-side Pagination**: The API endpoint needs to support `page` and `per_page` query parameters and return pagination metadata (`total` count) in the response for full pagination to work. If the API doesn't support pagination, the component falls back to client-side behavior.

3. **WebSocket Support**: The current real-time updates use polling. For lower latency updates, a WebSocket implementation could be added in the future.

4. **List Virtualization**: For extremely large datasets (hundreds of items), consider adding `react-window` or `react-virtualized` for windowed rendering. The current `maxItems: 100` limit provides a reasonable safeguard.
