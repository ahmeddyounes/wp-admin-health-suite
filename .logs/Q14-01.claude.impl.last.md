## Summary of Audit Findings

**Task Q14-01: SQL Injection Vulnerability Audit** - No code changes required.

I conducted a comprehensive security audit of all database-related PHP files for SQL injection vulnerabilities. The codebase follows proper SQL injection prevention practices throughout.

### Files Reviewed:
- `includes/Database/WpdbConnection.php` - ConnectionInterface wrapper
- `includes/Database/Optimizer.php` - Table optimization with dynamic table names
- `includes/Database/OrphanedTables.php` - Orphaned table detection/deletion
- `includes/Database/OrphanedCleaner.php` - Orphaned metadata cleanup
- `includes/Database/TransientsCleaner.php` - Transient management with LIKE queries
- `includes/Database/TrashCleaner.php` - Trash/spam content management
- `includes/Installer.php` - Plugin installation/uninstallation

### Security Patterns Verified:
| Pattern | Usage | Status |
|---------|-------|--------|
| `$wpdb->prepare()` with placeholders (`%s`, `%d`) | All parameterized queries | ✅ Properly used |
| `esc_sql()` for table names | Dynamic table names in DDL | ✅ Properly used |
| `esc_like()` for LIKE patterns | Transient/option queries | ✅ Properly used |
| Table name validation | Regex `/^[a-zA-Z0-9_]+$/` | ✅ Implemented |
| Backtick quoting | Table/column identifiers | ✅ Applied |
| Safe table references | `ConnectionInterface` methods | ✅ Used throughout |

### Key Findings:
- **No SQL injection vulnerabilities found**
- All user input is properly sanitized before use in queries
- Dynamic table names use both validation and escaping
- LIKE patterns properly use `esc_like()` to escape wildcards
- Batch processing uses prepared statements with LIMIT placeholders

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint check (159 warnings, 0 errors - all pre-existing JS warnings)
npm run lint

# Tests (417 tests passed)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **None identified** - The codebase demonstrates consistent and correct SQL injection prevention practices
- Pre-existing lint warnings are all JavaScript-related (JSDoc types, React prop-types) and unrelated to the security audit scope
