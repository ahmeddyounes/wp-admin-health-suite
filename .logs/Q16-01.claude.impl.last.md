### readme.txt (Corrections and Improvements)
1. **Tested up to**: Updated from `6.4` to `6.7` (more current WordPress version)
2. **Multisite FAQ**: Changed from "Currently not supported, planned for future" to accurately reflect that **multisite IS fully supported**
3. **Media retention**: Added configurable range (7-365 days) instead of just "30 days"
4. **Multilingual Support**: Added new section documenting WPML and Polylang integration
5. **Changelog**: Added "Multisite network support" to 1.0.0 release notes
6. **Roadmap**: Removed "Multisite network support" (already implemented), added Beaver Builder
7. **Formatting**: Improved WordPress plugin directory compliance with proper Markdown-style formatting for feature lists

### Key Accuracy Corrections
1. **Multisite Support**: The plugin has full multisite support (`includes/Multisite.php` with network admin menu, network settings, network-wide scans) - the old readme.txt incorrectly stated it wasn't supported
2. **Media Recovery Period**: Configurable 7-365 days (from `SafeDelete.php`), not just 30 days
3. **Integrations**: Added Multilingual (WPML/Polylang) from `includes/Integrations/Multilingual.php`

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run ESLint (warnings only, no errors expected)
npm run lint

# Run Jest tests (all 417 tests should pass)
npm test

# Review the updated files
cat README.md
cat readme.txt
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Placeholder URLs**: The documentation contains placeholder URLs (`yourname`, `yourusername`) that should be updated with actual contributor/organization names before publishing to WordPress plugin directory

2. **Screenshots**: The `readme.txt` references screenshots 1-6, but no actual screenshot files exist in `assets/images/`. These should be created and added before plugin directory submission

3. **WordPress Version**: Updated "Tested up to" to 6.7 - this should be verified by actually testing on WordPress 6.7 before publishing

4. **REST API Endpoints**: The README includes a REST API table. These endpoints should be verified against actual implementation to ensure accuracy
