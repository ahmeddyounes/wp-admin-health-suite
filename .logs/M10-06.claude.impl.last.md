Great! The file is comprehensive (662 lines). Let me create a summary of what was implemented:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully implemented M10-06 - WPML/Polylang Multilingual Compatibility integration:

### 1. Created `/includes/integrations/class-multilingual.php` (662 lines)
   - **Plugin Detection**: Detects WPML or Polylang activation
   - **Translation Handling**: 
     - `get_translations()` - retrieves all language versions of a post/attachment
     - `get_wpml_translations()` - WPML-specific translation lookup
     - `get_polylang_translations()` - Polylang-specific translation lookup
   
   - **Media Protection**:
     - `check_translated_media_usage()` - prevents translated media from being flagged as unused
     - Checks all translation versions for usage in featured images, content, and galleries
     - Filters attachments by language context
   
   - **Language Context**:
     - `get_current_language()` - respects admin language context
     - `get_languages()` - retrieves all available languages
     - `filter_attachments_by_language()` - filters results by language
   
   - **Duplicate Detection**:
     - `get_duplicate_translated_media()` - identifies media duplicated across languages
     - Groups duplicates by filename and language
   
   - **Statistics & Utilities**:
     - `get_posts_per_language()` - counts posts by language
     - `get_statistics()` - comprehensive multilingual stats
     - `get_version()` - retrieves plugin version

### 2. Updated `/includes/Plugin.php`
   - Added `$multilingual` property to store integration instance
   - Initialized multilingual integration in `load_dependencies()` method
   - Added `get_multilingual()` getter method for external access

### 3. Integration Features
   - **Hooks**: Integrates with media scanner via `wpha_media_is_attachment_used` filter
   - **Post Inclusion**: Adds filter for `wpha_media_reference_search_posts` to include translations
   - **Language-Aware Scanning**: Ensures all language versions are checked during media scans

## How to Verify

Run the following commands:

```bash
# Lint check (already passed)
npm run lint

# Test suite (already passed)
npm test
```

**Manual Testing (when WPML or Polylang is active):**
1. Install WPML or Polylang plugin
2. Create translated posts with media
3. Navigate to WP Admin Health Suite dashboard
4. Verify translated media is not flagged as unused
5. Check that language context is respected in admin pages

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk Items:
1. **Database Performance**: Queries check WPML/Polylang tables - may need optimization for large multilingual sites
2. **Language Context**: Current implementation relies on plugin functions being available - gracefully degrades if not

### Recommended Follow-ups:
1. **Testing with Real Plugins**: Test with actual WPML and Polylang installations to verify all edge cases
2. **Admin UI**: Consider adding language filter in media audit interface
3. **Settings**: Add option to enable/disable multilingual scanning in settings
4. **Performance**: Monitor query performance on sites with many languages/posts
5. **Documentation**: Add user documentation for multilingual features

### Code Quality:
- ✅ Follows WordPress coding standards
- ✅ Follows existing integration patterns (WooCommerce, ACF, Elementor)
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling and validation
- ✅ Proper use of WordPress database API (wpdb)
- ✅ PHPDoc comments throughout
- ✅ No linting errors
- ✅ All tests passing
