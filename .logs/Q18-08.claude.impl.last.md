**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

1. **Bug Fix**: Added missing `get_multisite()` method to `includes/Plugin.php` (lines 390-401)
   - The network templates (`templates/network/network-dashboard.php`, `templates/network/network-database.php`, `templates/network/network-settings.php`) were calling `$plugin->get_multisite()` but this method didn't exist
   - Added a convenience accessor method following the same pattern as `get_integration_manager()`

2. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive review document at `docs/multisite-support-review.md` covering:
   - Network activation detection and handling
   - Site-specific vs network-wide settings storage patterns
   - Blog switching patterns and proper usage
   - Security implementation (capability checks, sanitization)
   - Service provider integration

## How to Verify

```bash
# Syntax check
php -l includes/Plugin.php

# Run linting (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests
npm test

# Verify the method exists
grep -A10 "function get_multisite" includes/Plugin.php
```

## Files Modified/Created

- **Modified**: `includes/Plugin.php` - Added `get_multisite()` method
- **Created**: `docs/multisite-support-review.md` - Comprehensive review documentation

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Test Coverage**: No unit tests exist for the Multisite class. Consider adding tests for:
   - Network activation detection
   - Settings storage/retrieval
   - Capability checks

2. **Site Limit**: `get_network_sites()` limits to 999 sites. For very large networks, consider adding pagination support.

3. **Pre-existing Warnings**: The lint output shows 161 warnings (JSDoc types, prop-types, etc.) - these are pre-existing and unrelated to this task.
