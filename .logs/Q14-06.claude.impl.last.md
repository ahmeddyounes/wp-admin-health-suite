**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

**Input Sanitization Review Completed**

Reviewed all PHP files handling user inputs from `$_GET`, `$_POST`, `$_REQUEST`, and REST API parameters. The codebase demonstrates excellent sanitization practices throughout.

### Files Reviewed:
1. **templates/admin/settings.php** - Uses `sanitize_key()` for tab param, `sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash())` for message param ✓
2. **includes/Multisite.php** - Uses `wp_unslash()` + custom `sanitize_network_settings()` method ✓
3. **includes/Settings/SettingsServiceProvider.php** - Uses `sanitize_key()` with nonce verification ✓
4. **includes/Performance/AjaxMonitor.php** - Uses `sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash())` ✓
5. **templates/network/network-settings.php** - Fixed for consistency (see below)
6. **All REST Controllers** - Properly define `sanitize_callback` and `validate_callback` for all parameters ✓

### Change Made:
- **templates/network/network-settings.php:21** - Added `sanitize_text_field(wp_unslash())` to the `$_GET['updated']` check for consistency with WordPress coding standards, plus a phpcs ignore comment explaining the display-only nature of this check.

## How to verify

```bash
npm run lint   # Pass with only pre-existing warnings (0 errors)
npm test       # All 417 tests pass
```

## Risks / follow-ups

- **Low risk**: The change to `network-settings.php` is a conservative sanitization addition that does not change behavior (the previous direct comparison was already safe since it only compared against a literal string).
- **None identified**: The codebase already follows WordPress sanitization best practices. All user inputs are properly sanitized before use.
