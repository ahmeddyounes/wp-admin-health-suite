**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

**Task Q12-05: Recommendations Component Review**

Reviewed `assets/js/components/Recommendations.jsx` for:
1. **Recommendation display** - Component properly displays prioritized recommendations with title, description, severity badges, and category icons
2. **One-click fix integration** - "Fix Now" button executes actions via API and shows completion animation
3. **Priority indicators** - Severity colors and icons correctly map to impact_estimate values (critical/high/medium/low)
4. **Action feedback** - Loading states, error alerts, and completion animations provide user feedback

**Changes made:**
- `assets/js/components/Recommendations.jsx:234` - Minor comment clarification
- `assets/js/components/Recommendations.test.jsx` - Added 16 new tests to improve coverage:
  - Fix Now action execution and error handling
  - Keyboard navigation (Enter/Space keys)
  - localStorage error handling (get/set)
  - API dismiss calls and error handling
  - Action type conditionals (cleanup/optimize vs configure)
  - Preview alert content
  - Edge cases (empty steps, missing steps, unknown category)
  - Graceful handling when wp.apiFetch is unavailable

**Coverage improved from:**
- Branches: 60.71% → 82.14%
- Functions: 59.09% → 70.45%
- Lines: 74.49% → 89.93%

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (0 errors expected)
npm run lint

# Run all tests (175 tests should pass)
npm test

# Run Recommendations tests specifically with coverage
npm test -- --testPathPattern="Recommendations.test.jsx" --coverage --collectCoverageFrom="assets/js/components/Recommendations.jsx"
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Hover handlers remain untested** - Lines 417-420, 457-460, 856-860, 895-898, 915-918, 935-938 are hover style handlers that are difficult to test with jsdom but don't affect functionality
2. **Lines 170-172** (onRefresh callback after fix completion with setTimeout) - The async timing makes this difficult to test but could be covered with more complex test setup if needed
3. **Preview uses alert()** - Consider replacing with a modal for better UX in production
