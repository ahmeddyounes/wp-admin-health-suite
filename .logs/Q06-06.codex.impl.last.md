Status: DONE

Summary of changes:
- Updated `includes/REST/ActivityController.php` to support `page`/`per_page` pagination (with legacy `limit` alias), `scan_type` / `scan_type_prefix` filtering, and tighter output sanitization (notably `created_at` → RFC3339 when possible).
- Updated `assets/js/components/ActivityTimeline.jsx` to handle both the legacy array response and the new paginated `{ items, ... }` response.

How to verify:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups:
- The `/wpha/v1/activity` response `data` is now an object (`{ items, total, ... }`); any external consumers expecting an array will need to read `data.items` (the bundled UI is backward-compatible).
