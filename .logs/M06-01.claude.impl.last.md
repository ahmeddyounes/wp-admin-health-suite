Perfect! Now let me verify the implementation by reviewing the key features:

1. ✅ Created `/includes/class-settings.php` using WordPress Settings API
2. ✅ Six sections defined: General, Database Cleanup, Media Audit, Performance, Scheduling, Advanced
3. ✅ Settings registered with `register_setting()`, sections with `add_settings_section()`, fields with `add_settings_field()`
4. ✅ Sanitization callbacks for each field type (boolean, integer, text, select)
5. ✅ Default values set during activation in Installer
6. ✅ Export settings as JSON functionality
7. ✅ Import settings from JSON functionality
8. ✅ Reset to defaults option
9. ✅ Settings class initialized in Plugin.php

Let me create a quick summary document showing the implementation details:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented the Settings Page Framework (M06-01) for the WP Admin Health Suite plugin. Here's what was created:

### Files Created:
1. **`includes/class-settings.php`** - Complete Settings class with WordPress Settings API integration

### Files Modified:
1. **`includes/class-installer.php`**
   - Added `set_default_settings()` method to initialize default settings on plugin activation
   - Updated `install()` method to call `set_default_settings()`
   - Updated `uninstall()` method to delete settings option

2. **`includes/Plugin.php`**
   - Added `$settings` property to store Settings instance
   - Initialized Settings class in `load_dependencies()` method
   - Added `get_settings()` getter method

3. **`wp-admin-health-suite.php`**
   - Added require statement for `class-settings.php` since it uses non-PSR-4 naming convention

### Features Implemented:

#### Settings Sections (6 sections):
- **General**: Dashboard widget enable/disable, health score threshold
- **Database Cleanup**: Options for cleaning revisions, auto-drafts, trashed posts, spam/trashed comments, expired transients, orphaned metadata
- **Media Audit**: Unused media scanning, retention days, excluded mime types
- **Performance**: Query monitoring, slow query threshold, AJAX monitoring, log retention
- **Scheduling**: Enable/disable scheduled tasks, cleanup frequency, scan frequency
- **Advanced**: Debug mode, delete data on uninstall, batch processing size

#### Core Functionality:
✅ All settings use `register_setting()` for proper WordPress integration
✅ Sections added with `add_settings_section()`
✅ Fields added with `add_settings_field()`
✅ Comprehensive sanitization callbacks:
   - `boolean` - for checkbox fields
   - `integer` - for number fields with min/max validation
   - `text` - for text input fields
   - `select` - for dropdown fields with option validation
✅ Default values defined and set during plugin activation
✅ Export settings to JSON with timestamp and version info
✅ Import settings from JSON with validation
✅ Reset settings to defaults functionality
✅ All operations protected with capability checks (`manage_options`) and nonce verification

## How to Verify

Since this is a framework implementation without UI, verification can be done through code inspection and WordPress admin:

1. **Check Settings Registration**:
   ```bash
   # Verify the class file exists and is properly structured
   cat includes/class-settings.php | grep -E "(register_setting|add_settings_section|add_settings_field)"
   ```

2. **Check Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Verify Settings class is loaded in main plugin file
   grep "class-settings.php" wp-admin-health-suite.php
   
   # Verify Settings is initialized in Plugin.php
   grep -A 2 "Initialize Settings" includes/Plugin.php
   ```

3. **Check Installer Integration**:
   ```bash
   # Verify default settings are initialized on activation
   grep -A 5 "set_default_settings" includes/class-installer.php
   ```

4. **Manual Testing** (if WordPress environment is available):
   - Activate the plugin and check that `wpha_settings` option is created in the database
   - Navigate to Admin Health → Settings page
   - Verify all 6 sections are displayed
   - Test saving settings
   - Test export functionality (should download JSON file)
   - Test import functionality (should accept valid JSON file)
   - Test reset to defaults (should restore default values)

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Risks:
- **Low Risk**: The settings framework is implemented but the UI template (`templates/admin/settings.php`) needs to be created to display the settings form to users
- **Low Risk**: Export/import endpoints are secured with nonces and capability checks, but file upload size limits should be considered for import

### Follow-ups:
1. Create the settings page UI template (`templates/admin/settings.php`) that:
   - Calls `settings_fields('wpha_settings_group')`
   - Calls `do_settings_sections('wpha_settings')`
   - Includes save, export, import, and reset buttons
   - Displays success/error messages

2. Add admin notices for settings operations (saved, imported, reset)

3. Consider adding settings validation error messages for better UX

4. Add settings documentation or help text for complex options

5. Consider implementing AJAX-based settings save for better UX

6. Add unit tests for sanitization callbacks
