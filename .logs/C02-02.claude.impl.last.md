PHPCS passes with no issues. The implementation is complete.

**Status: DONE**

**Summary of changes:**

1. **Created `includes/Admin/MenuRegistrar.php`** - A new service class that handles WordPress admin menu registration only (single responsibility). It depends on `PageRenderer` for rendering callbacks.

2. **Created `includes/Admin/PageRenderer.php`** - A new service class that handles template rendering only. It's responsible for:
   - Capability checking before rendering
   - Loading and rendering template files
   - Passing data to templates

3. **Updated `includes/Providers/BootstrapServiceProvider.php`**:
   - Replaced `Admin` class import with `MenuRegistrar` and `PageRenderer`
   - Updated `$provides` array with new service classes and aliases
   - Changed `register()` method to bind `PageRenderer` and `MenuRegistrar` as singletons
   - Updated `boot()` method to call `MenuRegistrar::register()` for hook registration
   - Moved `wpha_admin_init` action to BootstrapServiceProvider (was in old Admin class)

4. **Removed redundant files**:
   - `includes/Admin.php` - The old bootstrap wrapper class
   - `admin/Admin.php` - The orphaned legacy implementation
   - `includes/Admin/AdminMenu.php` - Replaced by MenuRegistrar/PageRenderer

**How to verify:**
```bash
npm run lint   # Should pass (only pre-existing warnings)
npm test       # All 417 tests pass
php -l includes/Admin/MenuRegistrar.php
php -l includes/Admin/PageRenderer.php
php -l includes/Providers/BootstrapServiceProvider.php
vendor/bin/phpcs includes/Admin/MenuRegistrar.php includes/Admin/PageRenderer.php includes/Providers/BootstrapServiceProvider.php
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
1. **Manual testing recommended** - The new services should work correctly but manual testing in a WordPress environment would confirm the admin menu renders properly.
2. **Backward compatibility** - If any external code was accessing the old `Admin` class or `AdminMenu` class directly, it will break. However, based on the codebase search, these were only used internally.
3. **Hook timing** - The `wpha_admin_init` action is now fired from `BootstrapServiceProvider::boot()` instead of the old `Admin` class. The behavior should be identical.
