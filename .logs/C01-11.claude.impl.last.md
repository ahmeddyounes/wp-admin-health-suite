The script gracefully handles macOS Bash 3.x by showing a warning and exiting successfully (code 0). The full validation will run on Ubuntu CI which has Bash 4+.

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

**Files Created:**
1. `scripts/check-case-sensitivity.sh` - Case-sensitivity validation script that performs 4 checks:
   - PSR-4 namespace-to-file-path mappings
   - `require`/`include` statement path casing
   - `use` statement class references
   - Integration class reference casing
   
2. `docs/developers/case-sensitivity.md` - Comprehensive documentation covering:
   - Background on the macOS vs Linux case-sensitivity problem
   - What each check validates
   - How to run locally (including macOS Bash 4+ instructions)
   - CI integration details
   - Common issues and fixes
   - Guide for adding new checks

**Files Modified:**
1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Added new `case-sensitivity` job that runs on `ubuntu-latest` before other jobs

## How to Verify

```bash
# 1. Run the case-sensitivity script locally (shows warning on macOS Bash 3.x)
./scripts/check-case-sensitivity.sh

# 2. On macOS with Bash 4+ installed via Homebrew:
/usr/local/bin/bash ./scripts/check-case-sensitivity.sh

# 3. Lint passes (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# 4. Tests pass
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **macOS Development Experience**: The script gracefully skips checks on macOS Bash 3.x. Developers should install Bash 4+ (`brew install bash`) to run full local validation, or rely on CI to catch issues.

2. **False Negatives on macOS**: The script's file existence checks use the filesystem, so on case-insensitive macOS, some checks may not detect issues that would fail on Linux. The CI (Ubuntu) job is the authoritative check.

3. **Potential Future Enhancement**: Consider adding the script to Composer scripts for convenience:
   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "check:case": "./scripts/check-case-sensitivity.sh"
   }
   ```
