## Status: DONE ✓

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive AI Recommendations Engine at `includes/ai/class-recommendations.php` with the following implementation:

### Files Created
- `includes/ai/class-recommendations.php` (20KB, 688 lines)
- `includes/ai/index.php` (security file)

### Core Methods Implemented
1. **generate_recommendations($force_refresh)** - Analyzes all scan results and generates prioritized recommendations with caching support
2. **prioritize_issues($recommendations)** - Calculates priority scores (1-10) based on impact, ease of fix, and risk level
3. **get_actionable_steps($recommendation_id)** - Returns detailed step-by-step instructions for specific recommendations
4. **dismiss_recommendation($recommendation_id)** - Permanently dismisses recommendations with persistent storage

### Recommendation Format (Per Spec)
Each recommendation includes: `id`, `priority` (1-10), `category`, `title`, `description`, `impact_estimate`, `action_type`, `action_params`, and actionable `steps`

### Categories Covered
- **Database**: Revisions cleanup, transients, orphaned metadata, table optimization, trash/spam
- **Media**: Unused files, duplicates, large files, missing alt text
- **Performance**: Slow queries, caching configuration, heavy plugins
- **Security**: Accessibility improvements (alt text)

### Key Features
- **Smart Prioritization**: Multi-factor algorithm considering impact, ease of fix, and risk
- **Caching**: 24-hour transient cache with force refresh capability
- **Persistent Dismissals**: Dismissed recommendations stored in wp_options and filtered automatically
- **Genuinely Actionable**: Each recommendation includes specific endpoints, types, and step-by-step instructions

## How to Verify

### Check Files
```bash
ls -lh includes/ai/
cat includes/ai/class-recommendations.php
```

### Verify Syntax
```bash
php -l includes/ai/class-recommendations.php
```

### Run Lint & Tests
```bash
npm run lint   # No linting configured yet
npm test       # No tests configured yet
```

### Usage Example
```php
use WPAdminHealth\AI\Recommendations;

$engine = new Recommendations();
$recommendations = $engine->generate_recommendations();
$steps = $engine->get_actionable_steps('db_revisions_cleanup');
$engine->dismiss_recommendation('media_unused_files');
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Low Risk Items
- Class integrates with existing scanner modules without modifications
- Uses WordPress standard APIs (transients, options)
- Includes proper error handling with try-catch blocks

### Potential Follow-ups
1. Add REST API endpoints to expose recommendations to frontend
2. Create automated tests for recommendation generation logic
3. Add more granular filtering options (by category, priority range)
4. Implement recommendation scheduling/reminders
5. Add analytics to track which recommendations are most often dismissed or acted upon
6. Consider adding recommendation expiration based on data freshness
