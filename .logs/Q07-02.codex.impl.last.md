Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Deduped the `delete_data_on_uninstall` setting (kept in General/Core; removed duplicate from Advanced) and expanded its description.
- Made Health Score caching respect the `health_score_cache_duration` setting by injecting `SettingsInterface` into `HealthCalculator`.
- Added wp-config overrides in `SettingsRegistry`: `WPHA_SAFE_MODE`, `WPHA_DEBUG_MODE`, and `WPHA_DISABLE_REST_API`.
- Enforced Safe Mode for database optimization/repair REST endpoints (returns preview-only payloads when enabled).
- Implemented core feature toggles: `enable_dashboard_widget` (WP dashboard widget) and `admin_bar_menu` (Admin Bar menu with quick links + Safe Mode indicator).

How to verify
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups
- The new WP dashboard widget can trigger a full health score calculation on a cold cache (slow on very large sites); it will use the configured cache duration afterward.
- Optimization/repair endpoints now return `preview_only` + `would_optimize` / `would_repair` fields in Safe Mode; any client assuming the “real” response shape may need to handle Safe Mode responses.
