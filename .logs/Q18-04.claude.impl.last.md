**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive review document at `docs/asset-loading-review.md` that analyzes the `includes/Assets.php` file covering:

1. **Script/Style Enqueueing Patterns** - Proper use of `wp_enqueue_style()` and `wp_enqueue_script()` with correct handle prefixing and footer loading

2. **Conditional Loading by Admin Page** - Correctly uses `get_current_screen()` to only load assets on plugin pages, with page-specific CSS/JS bundles mapped to screen IDs

3. **Version Strings for Cache Busting** - Uses `filemtime()` in development (when `WP_DEBUG` is true) for immediate cache invalidation, and plugin version in production

4. **Dependency Management** - Integrates with webpack-generated `assets.php` manifest, properly chains dependencies including vendor bundles, React, ReactDOM, and wp-i18n

5. **Additional Features Reviewed**:
   - Script localization with `wp_localize_script()`
   - Translation support via `wp_set_script_translations()`
   - Async/defer script attributes
   - Hook registration and extensibility

**Key Findings**:
- Overall implementation is **Good**
- Minor issues: Missing CSS for Settings page, `tables.css` not enqueued, webpack version hashes not used for JS bundles
- Recommendations: Add REST nonce to localized data, use `wp_script_add_data()` for defer attributes

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint check (should pass with warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all should pass)
npm test

# View the review document
cat docs/asset-loading-review.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Low Risk**: The `tables.css` file exists but is never enqueued - consider removing it or loading it where needed
2. **Low Risk**: Settings page lacks page-specific CSS mapping - may want to add if needed
3. **Medium Priority**: Consider adding REST nonce to `wpAdminHealthData` for authenticated REST API calls
4. **Low Priority**: Could leverage webpack content hashes from `assets.php` for better production cache busting
