   - Proper direct access protection
   - Correct multisite validation
   - All outputs properly escaped
   - Correct WordPress multisite function usage

2. **network-database.php** - PASS (with recommendations)
   - Properly uses `switch_to_blog()`/`restore_current_blog()` pattern

3. **network-settings.php** - PASS
   - CSRF protection with nonces
   - Proper form submission to network admin endpoint

The review documents:
- Security checklist (all items pass)
- Multisite-specific checklist (all items pass)
- Capability and permission model verification
- Best practices observed
- Minor improvement recommendations (accessibility, inline styles, query optimization)

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 pass)
npm test

# Review the documentation
cat docs/network-multisite-templates-review.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **No code changes** - this was a review-only task
- **Minor recommendations** in the review document for future consideration:
  1. Move inline `<style>` block in `network-dashboard.php` to external stylesheet
  2. Add ARIA landmarks and skip links for accessibility
  3. Consider pagination/caching for database queries on large networks
- The lint warnings (161) are pre-existing and not related to this task
