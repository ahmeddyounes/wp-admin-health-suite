**Status: DONE**

## Summary of changes

Created a new test file for the database-health entry point:

- **`assets/js/entries/database-health.test.js`**: Comprehensive tests for the database health entry point including:
  - Tests that `window.WPAdminHealthComponents` global is exposed
  - Tests for `MetricCard` component export
  - Tests for `ActivityTimeline` component export
  - Tests for `React` and `createRoot` exports
  - Tests validating components are valid React functions
  - Tests for global namespace preservation (verifying `Object.assign` doesn't overwrite existing properties)

## How to verify

```bash
# Run lint
npm run lint

# Run all tests  
npm test

# Or run only the new test file
npx jest assets/js/entries/database-health.test.js
```

## Risks / follow-ups

1. **No risks identified**: The test file follows the established patterns from `dashboard.test.js` and all 223 tests pass.

2. **Follow-up consideration**: The `database-health.js` core module (jQuery-based) doesn't have its own unit tests. The spec was specifically for reviewing the entry point, which is now covered. Testing the jQuery-based `DatabaseHealth` object would require jQuery DOM testing setup, which is outside the scope of this task.

3. **Existing lint warnings**: There are 159 lint warnings (not errors) in the codebase, mostly related to missing JSDoc types and React prop-types. These are pre-existing and unrelated to this task.
