## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created a comprehensive review document at `docs/installer-review.md` that analyzes the `includes/Installer.php` file covering:

1. **Activation Hooks** - Evaluated the registration flow (`register_activation_hook`), multisite support (loop over all sites), custom action hooks (`wpha_activate`, `wpha_activated`), and defense-in-depth capability checks.

2. **Deactivation Hooks** - Reviewed the lightweight deactivation process that preserves data, flushes rewrite rules, and provides extension points.

3. **Uninstall Process** - Analyzed the multi-layer safety mechanism: `WP_UNINSTALL_PLUGIN` constant, `WPHA_DELETE_PLUGIN_DATA` constant, capability checks, and `delete_data_on_uninstall` setting. Comprehensive cleanup of tables, options, transients, and cron events.

4. **Database Table Creation** - Reviewed all 5 custom tables (`wpha_scan_history`, `wpha_scheduled_tasks`, `wpha_deleted_media`, `wpha_query_log`, `wpha_ajax_log`) with proper `dbDelta()` usage, charset/collation handling, and appropriate indexes.

5. **Default Settings Initialization** - Evaluated the domain-driven settings architecture with conservative defaults (most cleanup options disabled by default) and fresh install detection.

6. **Initial Task Scheduling** - Reviewed the handling of the edge case where `update_option_{$option}` doesn't fire on fresh installs, with proper timezone-aware scheduling and Action Scheduler support.

7. **Upgrade Migrations** - Analyzed the version comparison logic, dbDelta-based schema upgrades, and `wpha_upgraded` action hook for third-party extensions.

8. **Multisite Support** - Comprehensive review of network activation, new site auto-installation via `wp_initialize_site` hook, and network-wide uninstall.

9. **Security Analysis** - Verified capability checks, SQL preparation, and uninstall guards.

**Overall Rating: Excellent** - The implementation follows WordPress best practices with multiple safety layers, proper multisite support, and good extensibility.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run lint (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test

# Review the generated document
cat docs/installer-review.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

- **Low Risk**: No code changes were made; this was a review task only
- **Documentation Follow-up**: Consider adding user-facing documentation about the dual-guard uninstall safety mechanism (users must enable both `WPHA_DELETE_PLUGIN_DATA` constant AND the `delete_data_on_uninstall` setting)
- **Future Enhancement**: If version-specific data migrations are needed in future releases, the pattern should be added to the `upgrade()` method
