Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Auto-register WP-Cron/Action Scheduler hooks per task on registry registration (so any registered task can be executed via `wpha_{task_id}`) in `includes/Scheduler/SchedulerRegistry.php:263`.
- Added schedule management + discovery helpers to the registry (`get_task_hook`, `schedule_task`, `unschedule_task`, `get_next_run`) in `includes/Scheduler/SchedulerRegistry.php:115`.
- Added an option-based lock fallback when MySQL `GET_LOCK()` is unavailable, and switched lock keys to a stable `md5(task_id)` form in `includes/Scheduler/SchedulerRegistry.php:315`.
- Simplified Scheduler cron hook wiring: removed hardcoded per-task `add_action` calls and made the generic executor hook safer, plus inject `ConnectionInterface` into the registry for lock queries in `includes/Providers/SchedulerServiceProvider.php:195`.

How to verify
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups
- `npm run lint` reports warnings (no errors); `npm test` passes but prints React `act(...)` warnings to console.
- New registry methods (`schedule_task`, `unschedule_task`, etc.) aren’t declared on `SchedulerRegistryInterface` yet; consider adding them when doing Q08-03 if you want to call them via the interface type.
