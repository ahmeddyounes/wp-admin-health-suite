**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:**
Created a comprehensive review document at `docs/admin-menu-page-registration-review.md` that evaluates:

1. **File Structure and Architecture** - Two-class architecture with clean separation of concerns between bootstrap (`includes/Admin.php`) and implementation (`admin/Admin.php`)

2. **Admin Menu Registration** - Proper use of `add_menu_page()` and `add_submenu_page()` with internationalized labels, consistent slugs, and appropriate positioning

3. **Capability Requirements** - Defense in depth with `manage_options` checks at both menu registration and render time

4. **Page Callbacks and Template System** - DRY `render_page()` method with file existence validation and error handling

5. **Template Security** - All templates have direct access prevention, output escaping, and nonce protection where applicable

6. **Admin Body Class** - Scoped CSS styling with `wpha-admin-page` class

7. **WordPress Coding Standards Compliance** - Full compliance with docblocks, escaping, and indentation

8. **Accessibility** - Excellent implementation with skip links, ARIA landmarks, and live regions in templates

**How to verify:**
```bash
# View the created documentation
cat docs/admin-menu-page-registration-review.md

# Run lint (pre-existing warnings only, 0 errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (all 417 tests pass)
npm test
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- None identified. The existing implementation follows WordPress best practices thoroughly.
- Low-priority enhancement noted in documentation: Consider custom capabilities for granular multisite/team access control.
