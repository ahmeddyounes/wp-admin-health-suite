The implementation is complete. Let me provide the summary.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Created `scripts/check-autoload-sanity.php`
A PHP script that verifies key plugin classes can be autoloaded correctly. This script:
- Sets up WordPress stubs (constants and core class stubs) to allow class loading without a full WordPress environment
- Checks 54 key classes including:
  - Plugin class
  - Container classes
  - All 13 service providers
  - Key domain classes (Installer, Multisite, Assets, Database, Settings, etc.)
  - Integration classes
  - Scheduler classes
  - REST controllers
  - Application layer use cases
  - Admin classes
  - Exception classes
  - Contracts/Interfaces
- Exits with code 0 on success, 1 on failure
- Provides clear output with colored checkmarks/X marks for each class
- Includes helpful error messages when failures occur

### 2. Updated `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
Added a new CI job `autoload-sanity` that:
- Runs on `ubuntu-latest` (Linux, case-sensitive filesystem)
- Sets up PHP 7.4
- Executes the autoload sanity check script
- Fails the build if any classes cannot be loaded

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run the autoload sanity check locally
php scripts/check-autoload-sanity.php

# Run linting (should pass with only warnings)
npm run lint

# Run tests (should pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **WordPress Stubs**: The script uses minimal stubs for WordPress core classes (`WP_REST_Controller`, `WP_REST_Request`, `WP_REST_Response`, `WP_Error`, `WP_Admin_Bar`). If new plugin classes extend other WordPress core classes, the stubs may need to be expanded.

2. **Class List Maintenance**: If new key classes are added to the plugin, they should be added to the `get_classes_to_verify()` function in the script to ensure they're also checked.

3. **CI Job Order**: The autoload-sanity job runs independently without dependencies. If casing issues are detected, the job will fail early before other expensive jobs run.
