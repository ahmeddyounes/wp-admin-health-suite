Perfect! Now let me verify the spec requirements one more time by reading the spec:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

I have successfully implemented the Safe Media Deletion System (M03-06) with the following components:

### 1. Database Table (`includes/class-installer.php`)
- Added `wpha_deleted_media` table creation in the `create_tables()` method with the following schema:
  - `id` (primary key, auto-increment)
  - `attachment_id` (bigint, indexed)
  - `file_path` (text)
  - `metadata` (longtext - stores JSON)
  - `deleted_at` (datetime, indexed)
  - `permanent_at` (datetime, indexed, nullable)
- Added table cleanup in the `uninstall()` method

### 2. Safe_Delete Class (`includes/media/class-safe-delete.php`)
Created a comprehensive class with all required methods:

- **`prepare_deletion($attachment_ids)`**: Moves files to `/wp-content/wpha-trash/` and stores metadata
  - Validates attachments exist
  - Collects complete metadata (title, excerpt, content, mime type, parent, GUID, attachment metadata, alt text)
  - Moves main files and all thumbnails to trash directory
  - Creates database records
  - Soft-deletes WordPress attachment posts
  - Returns detailed results with prepared items and errors

- **`execute_deletion($deletion_id)`**: Permanently removes files and updates records
  - Deletes main file and thumbnails from trash
  - Updates record with `permanent_at` timestamp
  - Returns success/failure status

- **`restore_deleted($deletion_id)`**: Recovers deleted items within 30-day window
  - Validates item can be restored (not permanently deleted)
  - Restores main file and all thumbnails to original locations
  - Recreates WordPress attachment post with all metadata
  - Restores alt text and attachment metadata
  - Removes deletion record from database

- **`get_deletion_queue()`**: Returns list of items pending permanent deletion
  - Shows items not yet permanently deleted
  - Calculates days remaining until auto-purge
  - Includes file name, mime type, and deletion date

- **`get_deleted_history($limit)`**: Returns history of permanently deleted items
  - Shows up to specified limit of permanent deletions
  - Ordered by permanent deletion date

- **`auto_purge_expired()`**: Automatically removes items older than 30 days
  - Identifies items past retention period
  - Executes permanent deletion
  - Returns count of purged items

### Additional Features
- **Trash directory management**: Creates `/wp-content/wpha-trash/` with security index.php
- **Unique file naming**: Uses `{attachment_id}_{timestamp}_{original_name}` pattern
- **Comprehensive metadata storage**: Stores all necessary data for perfect restoration
- **Thumbnail handling**: Moves and restores all thumbnail sizes
- **Error handling**: Detailed error reporting for failed operations

## How to Verify

### Verification Commands
```bash
# Lint (no linter configured)
npm run lint

# Test (no tests configured)
npm test

# Syntax check
php -l includes/media/class-safe-delete.php
php -l includes/class-installer.php
```

### Manual Verification Steps
1. Activate the plugin to trigger database table creation
2. Verify `wpha_deleted_media` table exists in database
3. Test the workflow:
   ```php
   $safe_delete = new \WPAdminHealth\Media\Safe_Delete();
   
   // Prepare deletion
   $result = $safe_delete->prepare_deletion([123, 456]);
   
   // View deletion queue
   $queue = $safe_delete->get_deletion_queue();
   
   // Restore an item
   $restore = $safe_delete->restore_deleted($deletion_id);
   
   // Execute permanent deletion
   $execute = $safe_delete->execute_deletion($deletion_id);
   
   // Auto-purge expired items
   $purge = $safe_delete->auto_purge_expired();
   ```

### Files Modified/Created
- `includes/class-installer.php` (modified - added table creation/deletion)
- `includes/media/class-safe-delete.php` (created - 545 lines)

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Risks
1. **File system permissions**: The trash directory creation requires write permissions in `/wp-content/`
2. **Large file handling**: Moving very large files could timeout on some hosting environments
3. **Concurrent deletions**: Multiple simultaneous deletions could create race conditions
4. **Disk space**: Trash directory will consume disk space for 30 days

### Recommended Follow-ups
1. **Scheduled auto-purge**: Add WP-Cron job to run `auto_purge_expired()` daily
2. **REST API endpoints**: Create endpoints for frontend integration
3. **Admin UI**: Build interface for viewing queue and managing deletions
4. **Disk space monitoring**: Add checks to ensure sufficient space before deletion
5. **Bulk operations**: Add progress tracking for large batch operations
6. **Error logging**: Integrate with WordPress error logging for debugging
7. **Security**: Add capability checks (e.g., `delete_posts`) before allowing deletions
8. **Testing**: Add PHPUnit tests for all methods

### Next Steps
The Safe_Delete class is ready to be integrated with the plugin's REST API and admin interface for user-facing functionality.
