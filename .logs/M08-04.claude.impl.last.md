## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created comprehensive user documentation file `docs/media-audit.md` covering all aspects of the Media Audit feature:

### Documentation Sections Created:

1. **How Media Scanning Works** - Explains the scanning process, when to run scans, how to trigger them, and scan limitations
2. **Understanding 'Unused' Media** - Covers detection criteria, common false positives (hardcoded URLs, JavaScript references, external links, etc.), scan detection methods, and best practices to avoid issues
3. **Duplicate Detection** - Explains what duplicates are, how detection works using content hashing, duplicate cleanup strategies, and prevention tips
4. **Large File Optimization** - Covers why large files matter, size thresholds, optimization strategies (resizing, compression, format optimization, lazy loading), and expected results
5. **Missing Alt Text** - Explains accessibility importance, SEO benefits, how to write good alt text, bulk fixing methods, and compliance requirements
6. **Safe Deletion Process** - Details the three-stage deletion process (trash → verification → permanent), restoration procedures, and comprehensive safety checklists
7. **Integration with Page Builders** - Covers Elementor, Divi, Beaver Builder, WPBakery, and Gutenberg with detection capabilities, testing procedures, and troubleshooting

### Key Features of the Documentation:

- **Comprehensive coverage** of all media audit features mentioned in the spec
- **Real-world examples** and code snippets for clarity
- **Safety-first approach** with multiple checklists and warnings
- **False positive explanations** to help users understand scan limitations
- **Page builder integration notes** for popular builders
- **Step-by-step workflows** for common tasks
- **Best practices** for ongoing maintenance
- **Consistent formatting** matching the existing database-cleanup.md style

## How to Verify

### Exact Commands:

```bash
# Lint (passed with warnings only - no errors)
npm run lint

# Tests (passed - no test failures)
npm test
```

### Manual Verification:

1. **Check file exists**: `ls -la docs/media-audit.md`
2. **View documentation**: Open `docs/media-audit.md` in a markdown viewer
3. **Verify completeness**: Confirm all sections from spec are present:
   - ✅ How Media Scanning Works
   - ✅ Understanding 'Unused' Media (false positives, limitations)
   - ✅ Duplicate Detection
   - ✅ Large File Optimization
   - ✅ Missing Alt Text (why it matters, bulk fixing)
   - ✅ Safe Deletion Process (trash, restore, permanent)
   - ✅ Integration notes for page builders

## Risks / Follow-ups

### Risks:
- **Low Risk**: Documentation only - no code changes
- Users should still exercise caution and follow the safety guidelines in the documentation

### Follow-ups:
1. Consider adding screenshots to the documentation for visual clarity (can be done later)
2. May need to update documentation if media audit features change
3. Could add links to video tutorials if created
4. Consider translating to other languages for wider accessibility
