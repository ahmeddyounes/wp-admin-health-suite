Dependencies on `ConnectionInterface` are correctly resolved through lazy evaluation since `DatabaseServiceProvider` is registered before any resolution occurs.\n\n2. **DatabaseServiceProvider** - Well-structured with `ConnectionInterface` registered first, then all dependent services. All bindings follow proper dependency order.\n\n3. **MediaServiceProvider** - **FIXED**: Reordered service registrations to follow best practices:\n   - Moved `ExclusionsInterface` to be registered first (no dependencies)\n   - Moved `ReferenceFinderInterface` and `SafeDeleteInterface` before services that depend on `ExclusionsInterface`\n   - Updated comments to clarify dependency relationships\n\n4. **PerformanceServiceProvider** - Deferred provider, correctly depends on `ConnectionInterface` from `DatabaseServiceProvider`. No issues.\n\n5. **AIServiceProvider** - Deferred provider with extensive dependencies on Database, Media, and Performance services. All dependencies are resolved from providers registered earlier in the chain.\n\n6. **RESTServiceProvider** - Deferred provider registering REST controllers. Extensive dependencies correctly resolved from earlier providers.\n\n7. **SchedulerServiceProvider** - Registers task scheduling services with dependencies on Database, Media, and Performance services. Plugin.php correctly notes it must come after those providers.\n\n### File Modified:\n- `includes/Providers/MediaServiceProvider.php` - Reordered service registrations to ensure dependency-free services are registered before dependent services\n\n## How to Verify\n\n```bash\nnpm run lint   # Should pass with only warnings (no errors)\nnpm test       # Should pass all 101 tests\n```\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n1. **Low Risk**: The change is behavioral equivalent since the container uses lazy resolution (closures are only called when services are requested, not when registered). The fix improves code clarity and follows best practices.\n\n2. **No breaking changes**: The `$provides` array order in `MediaServiceProvider` was not changed, only the internal registration order within `register()`.\n\n3. **Future consideration**: The `CoreServiceProvider` registers `HealthCalculator` which depends on `ConnectionInterface`, but `CoreServiceProvider` is registered before `DatabaseServiceProvider`. This works due to lazy evaluation but could be made more explicit by either:\n   - Moving `HealthCalculator` to `DatabaseServiceProvider` (since it depends on `ConnectionInterface`)\n   - Or adding a comment explaining the deferred dependency resolution","session_id":"bdc95fb1-f92f-4e02-9661-855ed8a2828f","total_cost_usd":1.39203775,"usage":{"input_tokens":994,"cache_creation_input_tokens":71979,"cache_read_input_tokens":1382638,"output_tokens":9289,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":71979}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":994,"outputTokens":9289,"cacheReadInputTokens":1382638,"cacheCreationInputTokens":71979,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.37838275,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":12815,"outputTokens":168,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.013655,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"ec32decf-daf4-4f8a-afd2-c37b04942424"}
