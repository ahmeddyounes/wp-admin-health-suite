## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Created `/docs/package-json-configuration-review.md` - a comprehensive review of the package.json configuration covering:

1. **Package Metadata** - Reviewed name, version, description, author, and license fields. Identified placeholder author and missing repository/engines/private fields.

2. **Keywords Configuration** - Verified relevant keywords for WordPress plugin discoverability.

3. **Production Dependencies** - Analyzed React, ReactDOM, and prop-types. Noted that React/ReactDOM are externalized in webpack but still listed as dependencies.

4. **Development Dependencies** - Comprehensive review of 23 dev dependencies across:
   - Build tools (Webpack ecosystem)
   - Babel transpilation
   - Testing (Jest ecosystem) - **identified version mismatch** between jest@29.x and babel-jest@30.x/jest-environment-jsdom@30.x
   - Linting & formatting (ESLint, Prettier)
   - WordPress integration packages
   - Git hooks (Husky, lint-staged)

5. **Script Definitions** - Verified all 10 npm scripts work correctly. Suggested additional scripts (test:watch, test:coverage, clean).

6. **Lint-Staged Configuration** - Reviewed pre-commit hooks for JS/JSX and other file types.

7. **Version Specifications** - Analyzed caret (^) ranges and lock file presence.

8. **Security Considerations** - Noted missing `private: true` field.

9. **WordPress Plugin Compatibility** - Verified React version alignment with WordPress 6.0+.

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint (should pass with warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Tests (all 417 tests should pass)
npm test

# Verify the review document was created
cat docs/package-json-configuration-review.md
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Jest Version Mismatch (Medium Priority)** - `jest-environment-jsdom@30.2.0` and `babel-jest@30.2.0` should be downgraded to `^29.7.0` to match `jest@29.7.0`. This could cause subtle test issues.

2. **@babel/plugin-transform-runtime (Low Priority)** - Package is installed but not configured in babel/webpack. Either use it or remove it.

3. **Missing `private: true` (Medium Priority)** - Without this field, there's risk of accidental npm publish.

4. **Placeholder Author (Low Priority)** - "Your Name" should be updated to actual author/organization before release.
