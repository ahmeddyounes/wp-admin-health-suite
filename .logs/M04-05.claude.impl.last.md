Perfect! The syntax is valid. Now let me verify the implementation against the spec requirements one more time:

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

Successfully created `/includes/performance/class-cache-checker.php` with the `Cache_Checker` class that fully implements the M04-05 specification:

### Implemented Methods:
1. **`is_persistent_cache_available()`** - Checks if persistent cache is available by examining:
   - `$_wp_using_ext_object_cache` global
   - Presence of `object-cache.php` drop-in

2. **`get_cache_status()`** - Returns comprehensive cache status including:
   - Persistent cache availability
   - Cache type (Redis, Memcached, APCu, file-based, or none)
   - Cache backend detection
   - Available extensions
   - Hit rate (when available)
   - Additional cache information

3. **`test_cache_performance()`** - Benchmarks cache performance by:
   - Testing 100 set/get operations
   - Measuring individual operation times
   - Calculating average times, operations per second
   - Computing hit rate from the test
   - Cleaning up test data

4. **`get_cache_recommendations()`** - Provides actionable recommendations based on:
   - Current cache status
   - Hosting environment detection (WP Engine, Kinsta, Flywheel, Pantheon, VIP, Pressable, SiteGround, Cloudways, GoDaddy, WordPress.com, and generic)
   - Available cache extensions
   - Cache hit rates

### Additional Features:
- **Cache Type Detection**: Identifies Redis, Memcached, APCu, file-based cache, or no cache
- **Hosting Environment Detection**: Detects 10+ major WordPress hosting providers
- **Extension Detection**: Checks for Redis, Memcached, APCu availability
- **Hit Rate Calculation**: Extracts hit rates from cache objects when available
- **Hosting-Specific Recommendations**: Tailored advice for each hosting provider

## How to Verify

### Syntax Validation:
```bash
php -l includes/performance/class-cache-checker.php
```

### Lint (if configured):
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Tests (if configured):
```bash
npm test
```

### Manual Testing:
```php
// In WordPress context
use WPAdminHealth\Performance\Cache_Checker;

$checker = new Cache_Checker();

// Check if persistent cache is available
$is_available = $checker->is_persistent_cache_available();

// Get full cache status
$status = $checker->get_cache_status();

// Run performance test
$perf = $checker->test_cache_performance();

// Get recommendations
$recommendations = $checker->get_cache_recommendations();
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Integration**: The class is standalone and needs to be integrated into the plugin's initialization flow (Plugin.php or REST API endpoints) to be accessible.

2. **Performance Impact**: The `test_cache_performance()` method performs 200 cache operations (100 sets + 100 gets). This should only be run on-demand, not automatically.

3. **Hosting Detection**: The hosting environment detection relies on constants and server variables that may not be present in all environments. New hosting providers may need to be added over time.

4. **Extension Requirements**: Some cache backends require specific PHP extensions. The code checks for their availability but doesn't validate configuration (e.g., Redis connection settings).

5. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Add REST API endpoints to expose these methods
   - Add WP-CLI commands for cache testing
   - Create admin UI to display cache status and recommendations
   - Add scheduled health checks for cache performance
   - Implement more detailed Redis/Memcached connection testing
