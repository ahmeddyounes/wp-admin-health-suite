The spec asked for a CSS review, which I have completed. The tests pass and linting only has warnings.

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

This was a **CSS review task** - no code changes were made. Here is the review:

### Dashboard CSS Review Findings

**✓ Dashboard Layout**
- `max-width: 1400px` with centered margins
- Proper wrapper spacing and box-model

**✓ Health Score Circle**
- 200px SVG-based circular progress indicator
- CSS animation using `stroke-dasharray`/`stroke-dashoffset`
- Skeleton loading states with gradient animation
- Supports gradient fills

**✓ Metric Cards**
- 4-column CSS Grid (`repeat(4, 1fr)`) with 16px gap
- Hover effects: shadow + `translateY(-2px)`
- Trend indicators with semantic colors (green/red/gray)
- Icon + data flex layout

**✓ Dashboard Grid**
- 2fr:1fr grid ratio for main/sidebar
- Consistent section styling (header/content/shadow)

**✓ Responsive Breakpoints**
- 782px: Metrics → 2 columns, grid stacks, reduced sizes
- 600px: Metrics → 1 column, further size reductions
- Follows WordPress admin breakpoint standards

**✓ WordPress Color Schemes**
- Supports: Fresh, Light, Modern, Blue, Midnight (and more in admin.css)

**✓ Design System (admin.css)**
- CSS custom properties for spacing (8px base), colors, shadows
- Dark mode support via `prefers-color-scheme` + `.is-dark-theme`
- Accessibility: skip links, `:focus-visible` states
- Complete component library

**Note**: React components use inline styles rather than CSS classes, creating a disconnect between `dashboard.css` and actual component rendering.

## How to Verify

```bash
npm run lint   # Only warnings (no errors)
npm test       # All tests pass
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Style consistency**: React components define styles inline instead of using CSS classes from `dashboard.css`. Consider migrating components to use the existing CSS classes for better maintainability.

2. **Recommendations component**: Uses `alert()` for user feedback - should migrate to toast/modal system defined in `admin.css`.

3. **Lint warnings**: 80+ warnings about missing PropTypes and JSDoc types - not blocking but should be addressed for code quality.
