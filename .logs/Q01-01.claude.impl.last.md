# Run linter (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run tests (101 tests pass)
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

**No risks identified.** The architecture is production-ready.

**Optional future enhancements** (documented in `.t2/handoff/Q01-01.md`):
1. Formally implement `Psr\Container\ContainerInterface`
2. Add container tagging for service discovery patterns
3. Add optional priority parameter for provider boot order
