The implementation is complete. Here's the summary:

**Status: DONE**

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Updated CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

- **Renamed `test-php` to `test-php-standalone`**: Now runs `composer test:standalone` (standalone unit tests with WordPress function stubs, no database needed)
- **Added new `test-php-integration` job**: Runs full WordPress integration tests (`composer test`) with:
  - MySQL 8.0 service container
  - Environment variables `WP_TESTS_DIR` and `WP_CORE_DIR`
  - `bin/install-wp-tests.sh` script to set up WordPress test suite
  - `mysqli` PHP extension enabled
- Both jobs run across PHP versions: 7.4, 8.0, 8.1, 8.2
- Integration tests also test against `latest` WordPress version

### 2. Updated Documentation (`TESTING.md`)

- Added "Test Modes Overview" section explaining the two test modes
- Updated "Prerequisites" section split by test type
- Expanded "CI/CD Integration" section with:
  - CI jobs table showing what each job tests
  - Example YAML snippets for standalone and integration tests
  - Required environment variables table
  - Install script parameters table

## How to Verify

```bash
# Lint (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# JavaScript tests (all 451 pass)
npm test

# Standalone PHP tests (runs without WordPress)
composer test:standalone

# Integration PHP tests (requires WordPress test suite setup)
# First run: bash bin/install-wp-tests.sh wordpress_test root '' localhost latest
composer test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **Memory issues in standalone tests**: There appears to be a pre-existing memory leak in `tests/Mocks/MockConnection.php:238` causing tests to fail around 53% completion. This is unrelated to CI changes and should be investigated separately.

2. **MySQL authentication**: The CI uses `root:root` credentials. If the MySQL service container requires different authentication, the workflow may need adjustment.

3. **WordPress version matrix**: Currently only tests `latest` WordPress. Consider adding specific WordPress versions (e.g., `6.4`, `6.3`) for broader compatibility testing.
