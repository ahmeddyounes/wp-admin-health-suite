Identified placeholder author and missing repository/engines/private fields.\n\n2. **Keywords Configuration** - Verified relevant keywords for WordPress plugin discoverability.\n\n3. **Production Dependencies** - Analyzed React, ReactDOM, and prop-types. Noted that React/ReactDOM are externalized in webpack but still listed as dependencies.\n\n4. **Development Dependencies** - Comprehensive review of 23 dev dependencies across:\n   - Build tools (Webpack ecosystem)\n   - Babel transpilation\n   - Testing (Jest ecosystem) - **identified version mismatch** between jest@29.x and babel-jest@30.x/jest-environment-jsdom@30.x\n   - Linting & formatting (ESLint, Prettier)\n   - WordPress integration packages\n   - Git hooks (Husky, lint-staged)\n\n5. **Script Definitions** - Verified all 10 npm scripts work correctly. Suggested additional scripts (test:watch, test:coverage, clean).\n\n6. **Lint-Staged Configuration** - Reviewed pre-commit hooks for JS/JSX and other file types.\n\n7. **Version Specifications** - Analyzed caret (^) ranges and lock file presence.\n\n8. **Security Considerations** - Noted missing `private: true` field.\n\n9. **WordPress Plugin Compatibility** - Verified React version alignment with WordPress 6.0+.\n\n## How to Verify\n\n```bash\n# Lint (should pass with warnings only, no errors)\nnpm run lint\n\n# Tests (all 417 tests should pass)\nnpm test\n\n# Verify the review document was created\ncat docs/package-json-configuration-review.md\n```\n\n## Risks / Follow-ups\n\n1. **Jest Version Mismatch (Medium Priority)** - `jest-environment-jsdom@30.2.0` and `babel-jest@30.2.0` should be downgraded to `^29.7.0` to match `jest@29.7.0`. This could cause subtle test issues.\n\n2. **@babel/plugin-transform-runtime (Low Priority)** - Package is installed but not configured in babel/webpack. Either use it or remove it.\n\n3. **Missing `private: true` (Medium Priority)** - Without this field, there's risk of accidental npm publish.\n\n4. **Placeholder Author (Low Priority)** - \"Your Name\" should be updated to actual author/organization before release.","session_id":"732169ac-4bec-481f-898b-402563c4c8c3","total_cost_usd":1.1605152500000002,"usage":{"input_tokens":4701,"cache_creation_input_tokens":69169,"cache_read_input_tokens":889730,"output_tokens":9667,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0,"web_fetch_requests":0},"service_tier":"standard","cache_creation":{"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":69169}},"modelUsage":{"claude-opus-4-5-20251101":{"inputTokens":4701,"outputTokens":9667,"cacheReadInputTokens":889730,"cacheCreationInputTokens":69169,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":1.14235125,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000},"claude-haiku-4-5-20251001":{"inputTokens":17744,"outputTokens":84,"cacheReadInputTokens":0,"cacheCreationInputTokens":0,"webSearchRequests":0,"costUSD":0.018164,"contextWindow":200000,"maxOutputTokens":64000}},"permission_denials":[],"uuid":"867d3df0-84d0-4cbb-9b96-f5f631b8d174"}
