**Status**
- DONE

**Summary of changes**
- Expanded `includes/Settings/Domain/PerformanceSettings.php` with heartbeat enable/interval controls, AJAX monitoring limits (retention/max rows/slow threshold), and clearer monitoring descriptions.
- Wired heartbeat control to the main settings (`wpha_settings`) via `includes/Performance/HeartbeatController.php`, with one-time migration from legacy `wpha_heartbeat_settings`, and updated heartbeat REST endpoints to read/write the same settings.
- Made monitoring respect settings: `includes/Performance/QueryMonitor.php` now honors `query_logging_enabled` + threshold, `includes/REST/Performance/QueryAnalysisController.php` uses `slow_query_threshold_ms`, and `assets/js/performance.js` displays the live threshold label.
- Added settings-aware AJAX log pruning/limits in `includes/Performance/AjaxMonitor.php` and conditional monitor initialization in `includes/Providers/BootstrapServiceProvider.php`.

**How to verify**
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

**Risks / follow-ups**
- Heartbeat storage is now `wpha_settings`-backed (legacy `wpha_heartbeat_settings` is migrated/left for compatibility); any external code relying on the legacy option may need updating.
- Enabling query monitoring can increase memory usage (`$wpdb->save_queries`); enabling AJAX monitoring increases DB writes—tune the new retention/max-row settings as needed.
