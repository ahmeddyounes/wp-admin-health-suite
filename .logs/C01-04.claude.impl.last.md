The new ADR file `docs/decisions/ADR-003-frontend-modernization-scope.md` has been created and the architecture improvement plan has been updated to reference Section 11.

---

## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

1. **Created ADR-003** (`docs/decisions/ADR-003-frontend-modernization-scope.md`) - A comprehensive decision document that:
   - Chooses **Option A** (incremental improvements within current React + Webpack setup)
   - Documents why the current frontend is already mature and well-architected
   - Explains why `@wordpress/data`, `@wordpress/components`, and TypeScript are **not** needed in the first iteration
   - Defines clear **scope** (what Phase 4 will include)
   - Defines clear **non-goals** (what Phase 4 will explicitly exclude)
   - Provides **success criteria** for Phase 4 completion
   - Documents **future triggers** that would justify revisiting the decision

2. **Updated architecture improvement plan** (`docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md`):
   - Marked Question 4 as **DECIDED** with reference to Section 11
   - Added Section 11 summarizing the frontend modernization decision

## How to Verify

```bash
# Check the new ADR exists and has expected content
cat docs/decisions/ADR-003-frontend-modernization-scope.md | head -50

# Check the architecture plan references Section 11
grep -n "DECIDED.*Section 11" docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md

# Verify all questions are now decided
grep "DECIDED" docs/architecture-improvement-plan.md

# Run tests to ensure no regressions
npm test

# Run lint (warnings are pre-existing, not from this change)
npm run lint
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

1. **No risks** - This is a documentation-only change that records an architectural decision. No code was modified.

2. **Follow-ups for Phase 4 implementation:**
   - Audit `wp.apiFetch` usage and ensure all calls go through `ApiClient`
   - Audit `window.WPAdminHealthComponents` exports and document public API
   - Simplify PHP templates to minimal container divs
   - Ensure `rest_nonce` is consistently provided in localized data
   - Verify asset dependency registration is correct
