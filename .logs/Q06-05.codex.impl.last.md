Status: DONE

Summary of changes
- Prevented route collisions by stopping registration of the legacy performance controller (`includes/Providers/RESTServiceProvider.php:425`).
- Added `/wpha/v1/performance/score` as a legacy alias to the stats endpoint (`includes/REST/Performance/PerformanceStatsController.php:78`).
- Fixed autoload analysis accuracy by using `AutoloadAnalyzerInterface` for total size/count and improved cache clearing on updates (`includes/REST/Performance/AutoloadController.php:117`).
- Switched plugin impact and query analysis endpoints to use the injected profiler/monitor services and kept response shapes compatible with the existing UI (`includes/REST/Performance/PluginProfilerController.php:104`, `includes/REST/Performance/QueryAnalysisController.php:97`).
- Marked Q06-05 as completed in task tracking (`.t2/state.json:1`).

How to verify
- `npm run lint`
- `npm test`

Risks / follow-ups
- Plugin “load_time” and “memory” values may differ from prior heuristic output (now derived from the profiler); the UI bars may saturate more often.
- `savequeries` in query analysis now reflects “can capture” (Query Monitor plugin or `SAVEQUERIES`), not strictly `SAVEQUERIES`; adjust the UI messaging if you want the notice to be exact.
- Consider deprecating/removing `includes/REST/PerformanceController.php` since it’s no longer registered.
