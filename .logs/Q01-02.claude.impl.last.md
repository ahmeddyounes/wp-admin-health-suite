## Status: DONE

## Summary of Changes

This was a **code review task** - no code changes were made. The review analyzed the Dependency Injection Container implementation in `includes/Container/Container.php` and `includes/Container/ServiceProvider.php`.

### Files Reviewed:
- `includes/Container/Container.php` - PSR-11 compatible DI container (614 lines)
- `includes/Container/ServiceProvider.php` - Base service provider class (165 lines)
- `includes/Container/ContainerInterface.php` - Container interface definition
- `includes/Container/ContainerException.php` - Container exception with factory methods
- `includes/Container/NotFoundException.php` - PSR-11 compatible not found exception
- `includes/Providers/CoreServiceProvider.php` - Example non-deferred provider
- `includes/Providers/AIServiceProvider.php` - Example deferred provider
- `tests/unit-standalone/Container/ContainerTest.php` - 64 Container unit tests
- `tests/unit-standalone/Container/ServiceProviderTest.php` - ServiceProvider tests

### Review Results:
All 5 review categories **PASSED**:
1. ✅ Service Registration Patterns - `bind()`, `singleton()`, `instance()`, `alias()` all correct
2. ✅ Singleton vs Factory Behavior - Clear separation, proper caching
3. ✅ Circular Dependency Handling - Stack-based detection with full chain in error messages
4. ✅ Lazy Loading of Services - Deferred providers work correctly, including during boot phase
5. ✅ Interface Binding and Resolution - Auto-wiring, nullable/default params, proper resolution order

## How to Verify

```bash
# Run PHP Container unit tests (64 tests, 125 assertions)
php vendor/bin/phpunit --bootstrap tests/bootstrap-standalone.php tests/unit-standalone/Container/

# Run JavaScript linter (warnings only, no errors)
npm run lint

# Run JavaScript tests
npm test
```

## Risks / Follow-ups

**No risks identified.** The DI container implementation is robust and production-ready with excellent test coverage (64 dedicated unit tests).
