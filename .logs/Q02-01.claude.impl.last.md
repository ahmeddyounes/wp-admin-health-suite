Both lint and tests pass. The lint warnings are all pre-existing issues in JavaScript files (unrelated to the PHP Analyzer). All 101 tests pass.

## Summary

This was a **code review task** (Q02-01), not an implementation task. I reviewed `includes/database/Analyzer.php` for the criteria specified:

### Review Results

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **SQL Query Safety** | ✅ PASS | All queries with variable data use `$wpdb->prepare()` with proper placeholders. Table names come from trusted `$wpdb` properties via `ConnectionInterface`. |
| **Accurate Size Calculations** | ✅ PASS | Uses standard MySQL `data_length + index_length` from `information_schema.TABLES`. `data_free` for overhead. Uses `SUM()` aggregates. |
| **Caching Strategy (5-min TTL)** | ✅ PASS | `CACHE_EXPIRATION = 5 * MINUTE_IN_SECONDS`. Uses WordPress transients. In-memory properties prevent redundant queries within same request. |
| **N+1 Queries** | ✅ PASS | No N+1 patterns. All queries are single aggregate queries or single table scans. |
| **Large Database Handling** | ⚠️ NOTE | Orphaned meta queries don't use LIMIT for counts (acceptable for COUNT(*) which is optimized). `get_bloat_summary()` makes 9 separate queries but each is cached. |

### Potential Improvements (Not Required)

1. **Batch bloat counts**: `get_bloat_summary()` could combine queries, but in-memory caching mitigates this.
2. **Add LIMIT to orphaned queries for preview mode**: The current design is for counts which is fine, but if these grow to millions of orphaned records, even COUNT(*) with LEFT JOIN could be slow.

**Status:** DONE

**Summary of changes:** Code review only - no changes made. The Analyzer.php file is well-designed with proper SQL safety, accurate calculations, and appropriate caching.

**How to verify:**
```bash
npm run lint   # Passes (warnings are pre-existing JS issues)
npm test       # All 101 tests pass
```

**Risks / follow-ups:**
- None critical. The code follows WordPress best practices.
- Future consideration: For sites with millions of orphaned meta records, consider adding a configurable LIMIT to the orphaned count queries or implementing batched counting.
