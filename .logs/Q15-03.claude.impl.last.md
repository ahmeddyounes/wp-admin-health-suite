## Status: DONE

## Summary of changes

Created a comprehensive review document at `docs/standalone-test-review.md` that analyzes the `tests/unit-standalone/` directory for:

1. **WordPress Independence**: All 17 test files are confirmed to be WordPress independent
2. **Mock Usage Patterns**: Documented three key patterns:
   - MockConnection for database operations
   - Global variable injection for WordPress functions
   - StandaloneTestCase lifecycle management
3. **Component Isolation**: Verified through interface abstraction, dependency injection, function stubs, and global cleanup

Key findings:
- **17/17 test files** run without WordPress
- **100+ WordPress functions** are stubbed in `bootstrap-standalone.php`
- **MockConnection** provides complete database isolation with pattern matching
- **StandaloneTestCase** ensures proper setUp/tearDown lifecycle
- Test coverage spans Cache, Container, Integration, Media, Services, Settings, and Mocks

## How to verify

```bash
# Run lint (0 errors, 161 warnings - all pre-existing)
npm run lint

# Run tests (417 tests pass)
npm test

# View the review document
cat docs/standalone-test-review.md
```

## Risks / follow-ups

None - this was a review task that created documentation. The standalone test suite is well-designed and properly isolated from WordPress.
